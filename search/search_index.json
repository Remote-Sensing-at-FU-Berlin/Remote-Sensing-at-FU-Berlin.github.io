Loading point cloud data to R","text":"<p>Discrete return ALS sensors record a number of pieces of data. First and foremost, positional data in three dimensions (X,Y,Z) - this is normally referred to as the \"point cloud\". The most simple point clouds only include information about X,Y,Z position and nothing else. However, most laserscanning sensors record more information such as the intensity for each point, the position of each point in the return sequence (remember the \"multi-return\" capabilities of a single laser-beam discussed in the theoretical lecture), or the beam incidence angle of each point. Due to the often massive amounts of data that are collected during a laserscanning survey, reading, writing, and efficient storage of laserscanning data is a critical step prior to any subsequent analysis.</p> <p>ALS data is most commonly distributed in LAS format, which is specifically designed to store ALS data in a standardized way. These data are officially documented and maintained by the American Society for Photogrammetry &amp; Remote Sensing (ASPRS). LAS files do however require a large amount of memory because they are not compressed. The LAZ format has become the standard compression scheme, because it is free and open-source.</p> <p>The widespread use, standardization and open source nature of the LAS and LAZ formats promoted the development of the lidR package, which has been designed to process LAS and LAZ files both as input and output, taking advantage of the LASlib and LASzip C++ libraries via the rlas package.</p> <p>The function readLAS() reads a LAS or LAZ file and returns an object of class LAS. The LAS formal class is documented in depth in a dedicated vignette. To briefly summarize, a LAS file is made of two parts:</p> <ul> <li>The header that stores summary information about its content including the bounding box of the file, coordinate reference system, and point format.</li> <li>The payload, that is the point cloud itself.</li> </ul> <p>The function readLAS() reads and creates an object that contains both the header and the payload. We will now start the practical part by running the following code in R. Make sure that you also carefully read the comments provided in the code. We will now first load all the required packages. R will give you a warning message in case a package is not installed yet. If this is the case, please install the packages either through the main menu of Rstudio by selecting \"Tools\" =&gt; \"Install packages\" and then following the appearing dialogue, or by entering the corresponding R code to install the packages into the console. E.g., to install the package \"raster\" use the code:</p> <pre><code>install.packages(\"raster\")\n</code></pre> <p>But now let's load the packages and the dataset</p> <pre><code>############################\n## Loading LiDAR data to R\n############################\n\n\n# installing the lidR package (only required one time)\n# if the package is not installed yet\n\n\n# loading the lidR package\nrequire(lidR)\nrequire(stars)\nrequire(terra)\nrequire(sp)\nrequire(sf)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(gstat)\n\n# load the example dataset - a subset from an airborne\n# laserscanning survey conducted in 2020 in study site\n# near Karlsruhe in the South of Germany\n\n# load complete dataset (the path has to be adapted)\nlas &lt;- readLAS(\"D:/Studium/Projekt_1/ALS/BR01.laz\")\n</code></pre> <p>With these lines of code, you should have now loaded the ALS data. To make sure that the data is loaded correctly we can run:</p> <pre><code># check summary of loaded dataset\nsummary(las)\n</code></pre> <p>This should give us the following outputs:</p> <p></p> <p>We can see quite a lot of information is being displayed, but we will not go into every detail. A few points that are quite interesting is that we can see for example the total number of points is 1.74 million and based on the coordinates provided in the extent attribute we can see that the area covers roughly 130 x 130 m. We can also see that the file currently has no coordinate reference system assigned. </p> <p>By simply using the readLAS() command, we loaded the complete dataset into R - this is a quite good choice in many situations, but as we can see at the memory attribute, we also loaded a quite large dataset of 205.5 MB (hence the original file size of the compressed laz-file was increased by a factor of almost 10 since the original laz-file has a size of approximately 23 MB). </p> <p>In some cases, we might be interested in not loading the complete dataset but for example only the positional data while we might not be interested in loading information about intensity of scan-angle. Or we might only be interested in a specific type of returns, for example we might be interested in only using \"first return\" data (that is all 3D points that were recorded when the laser beam interacted with an object for the first time while we want to disregard any returns that followed) In such cases, the lidR package provides some options to read only parts of the dataset as exemplified in the code below:</p> <pre><code># It is also possible to only load specific subsets of the data\n# by either using the \"select\" argument to only load certain columns\n# of the dataset (columns are attributes - such as x, y, z position,\n# scan angle, return number, etc.)\n# or by using the filter argument to only load certain rows (data points) of the\n# dataset - for the latter the options are listed here\nreadLAS(filter = \"-help\")\n# load only 3D points and discard other information\nlas_xyz &lt;- readLAS(\"D:/00_FUB/3_lehre/2_Projekt_1/1_tree_attributes/Practicals/2_LiDAR/BR01.laz\", select=\"xyz\")\n# load complete dataset but only first returns\nlas_fr &lt;- readLAS(\"D:/00_FUB/3_lehre/2_Projekt_1/1_tree_attributes/Practicals/2_LiDAR/BR01.laz\", \"-keep_first\")\n</code></pre> <p>MINI-EXERCISE: Try to tun the lines above and check how the size of the loaded datasets has changed (memory attribute) using the summary command learned already above.</p> <p>As stated above, a typical lidar dataset does not only contain information about the point locations but also additional information. In the datasets we loaded so far, we can check what kind of additional data is stored by running:</p> <pre><code>names(las@data)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following output:</p> <p></p> <p>So we can see that each of the LiDAR point does not only have a X, Y and Z coordinate but many additional attributes that can be used during the analysis. Even though many of these attributes are not typically being used to extract information of the targeted variable (e.g., forest parameters). The only exceptions are Intensity and ReturnNumber which both normally carry some relevant information about the object with which the laser beam interacted. </p>"},{"location":"1_Laserscanning_lidR/1_Laserscanning_lidR/#2-visualizing-lidar-data-with-lidr","title":"2. Visualizing LiDAR data with lidR","text":"<p>The lidR package takes advantage of the rgl package to provide a versatile and interactive 3D viewer with points coloured by Z coordinates on a black background as default. The very basic way to render a point cloud is the function plot().</p> <pre><code>plot(las)\n</code></pre> <p>This will lead to the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>Be aware that the plot is actually interactive and in 3D. That is, by clicking and keeping the mouse-button clicked and then moving the mouse, you can rotate and shift the plot. Using the mouse-wheel you can zoom in and out. Try to play around a bit with this until you get familiar with the navigation in the plot.</p> <p>As is most R-plots, it is possible to refine and adapt the plot with numerous settings. Here is code for two examples. In the first example, the color of the points (which was determined by the height of the points in the first plot) will be set based on ScanAngle and in the second based on Intensity of the LiDAR returns. In both cases, the background will be set to white.</p> <pre><code># Plot las object by scan angle, \n# make the background white, \n# display XYZ axis and  scale colors\nplot(las, color = \"ScanAngle\", bg = \"white\", axis = TRUE, legend = TRUE)\n# use LiDAR intensity as color, use the break argument to improve color scale\nplot(las, color = \"Intensity\", breaks = \"quantile\", bg = \"white\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following two plots:</p> <p> </p> <p>As you can see, the x and y dimensions are not showing the actual coordinates of the area but start from the origin 0, 0. However, the heights (z axis) actually show their true values. In the current plots these are values above sea level. While these plots are quite nice, there are many cases where a transect view of the point cloud may be more efficient to visually examine the details of a LiDAR point cloud, particularly if the dataset shows a forest. In the lidR package it is also possible to depict transect views, but there are several steps necessary to achieve this. </p> <p>First, we have to clip the point-cloud to remain only a small strip (= the transect). There is a dedicated function to do this and we have to define the start point and the end point of the transect as well as a width (in meter). We can do this with the following code:</p> <pre><code># make transect plot\n# have a look at y and y coordinates to define start and end point\n# point coordinates have to lay between min and max of X and Y variables\nsummary(las$X)\nsummary(las$Y)\n\n# define some start and end point\np1 &lt;- c(476715, 5429035)\np2 &lt;- c(476758, 5429075)\n\n# clip transect\nlas_tr &lt;- clip_transect(las, p1, p2, width = 2, xz = TRUE)\n</code></pre> <p>Now we clipped out a small transect of our plot and we can visualize it using the ggplot function. You might already be familiar with ggplot from other courses in which you used R. It is probably the most famous R-package for preparing more advanced plots and there is ample literature on the package on the internet. I will hence not go into the details of the parameters here, but you can play around a bit for example with the parameter used for coloring the points (argument \"color = Z\") as well as the point size (argument \"size = 0.5\").</p> <pre><code># plot transect\nggplot(las_tr@data, aes(X,Z, color = Z)) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5) + \n  coord_equal() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_gradientn(colours = height.colors(50))\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>Since creating a transect plot requires several steps and we might be interested in plotting transects a bit more frequently later on, we can define a custom function that allows us to plot a transect view of our dataset. I will not go into details to explain what the function does exactly here, but we will use it a few times in the parts below. Hence, simple run the complete code below in R and the function will become available in the next parts of the tutorial.</p> <pre><code># prepare function to make transect plotting more easy\nplot_crossection &lt;- function(las,\n                             p1 = c(min(las@data$X), mean(las@data$Y)),\n                             p2 = c(max(las@data$X), mean(las@data$Y)),\n                             width = 4, colour_by = NULL)\n{\n  colour_by &lt;- enquo(colour_by)\n  data_clip &lt;- clip_transect(las, p1, p2, width)\n  p &lt;- ggplot(data_clip@data, aes(X,Z)) + geom_point(size = 0.5) + coord_equal() + theme_minimal()\n\n  if (!is.null(colour_by))\n    p &lt;- p + aes(color = !!colour_by) + labs(color = \"\")\n\n  return(p)\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"1_Laserscanning_lidR/1_Laserscanning_lidR/#ground-classification","title":"Ground classification","text":"<p>Classification of ground points is an important step in processing point cloud data. Distinguishing between ground and non-ground points allows creation of a continuous model of terrain elevation often referred to as \"digital terrain model\" (DTM). DTMs are useful for many applications such as calculating the run-off in hydrological models, determining suitable positions for wind turbines or deriving aspect and slope information. Many algorithms to classify ground points have been reported in the literature and lidR currently provides two of them: Progressive Morphological Filter (PMF) and Cloth Simulation Function (CSF) usable with the function classify_ground(). The lidRplugins package provides an additional algorithm called Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC).</p> <p>The implementation of PMF algorithm in lidR is based on the method described in Zhang et al. (2003) with some technical modifications. The original method is raster-based, while lidR performs point-based morphological operations because lidR is a point cloud oriented software. The main step of the methods are summarised in the  following figure (taken from the lidR book).</p> <p></p> <p>The pmf() function requires defining the following input parameters: ws (window size or sequence of window sizes), and th (threshold size or sequence of threshold heights). More experienced users may experiment with these parameters to achieve best classification accuracy, however the lidR also contains the util_makeZhangParam() function that includes the default parameter values described in Zhang et al. (2003).</p> <p>To conduct a ground classification on our dataset, we run the following lines of code:</p> <pre><code>las &lt;- classify_ground(las, algorithm = pmf(ws = 5, th = 3))\nplot(las, color = \"Classification\", size = 3, bg = \"white\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will take a moment of processing time and then we can have a look at the classification be using the plot_crossection function that we defined above:</p> <pre><code># have a look at the classification in a transect view\n# define start and end point\np1 &lt;- c(476715, 5429035)\np2 &lt;- c(476758, 5429075)\nplot_crossection(las, p1 , p2, colour_by = factor(Classification))\n</code></pre> <p>This results in the following plot</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that the result is not yet perfect as some points that were classified as ground appear to be rather part of the understorey of the forest (some example points are marked in the black box). In the following we will address this issue be refining the PMF algorithm by using not only a single window size but three different window sizes and providing a sequence of threshold heights. In the given case, the provided settings will lead to a quite decent result, but you can try out other parameters as well. The optimal set of parameters may vary depending on your dataset. For example areas with very rough terrain may require other settings than rather flat areas.</p> <pre><code># adjust ground classification algorithm\nws &lt;- seq(3, 12, 3)\nth &lt;- seq(0.1, 1.5, length.out = length(ws))\nlas &lt;- classify_ground(las, algorithm = pmf(ws = ws, th = th))\nplot_crossection(las, p1 , p2, colour_by = factor(Classification))\n</code></pre> <p>Running this code will take a bit more time since multiple window sizes and thresholds are applied. Finally, this should result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>This results looks quite nice and almost all of the points that were classified as ground (green color) look plausible. The classification is stored as an additional attribute in the las-file and we can use the attribute to filter the file and obtain only points that were classified as ground point.

If you at some point work with an own dataset and face problems in obtaining a high-quality ground classification, it might be worthwhile to examine the alternative methods of the package which are described with more details in the lidR book (see link at the beginning of this tutorial). </p>"},{"location":"1_Laserscanning_lidR/1_Laserscanning_lidR/#calculate-a-digital-terrain-model","title":"Calculate a digital terrain model","text":"<p>Generating a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is usually the next step in processing that follows classification of ground points. Put simply, a DTM can be described as an \u201cimage\u201d of the ground. Methods to generate DTMs have been intensively studied and several algorithms have been proposed for various terrain situations. DTMs are used for a variety of purposes in practice, such as determination of the catchment basins of water retention and stream flow, or the identification of drivable roads to access resources. It also enables users to normalize point clouds i.e. subtract the local terrain from the elevation of points to allow a manipulation of point clouds as if they were acquired on a flat surface.</p> <p>The construction of a DTM starts with known or sampled ground points and uses various spatial interpolation techniques to infer ground points at unsampled locations. The accuracy of the DTM is very important because errors will propagate to future processing stages like tree height estimation. A wide range of methods exist for spatial interpolation of points.</p> <p>Below you will find the codes to run three interpolation methods and some information about each of the method.</p>"},{"location":"1_Laserscanning_lidR/1_Laserscanning_lidR/#triangular-irregular-network","title":"Triangular irregular network","text":"<p>This method is based on triangular irregular network (TIN) of ground point data to derive a bivariate function for each triangle, which is then used to estimate the values at unsampled locations (between known ground points).</p> <p>Planar facets of each generated triangle are used to interpolate. Used with a Delaunay triangulation, this is the most simple solution because it involves no parameters. The Delaunay triangulation is unique and the linear interpolation is parameter-free. The drawbacks of the method are that it creates a non-smooth DTM and that it cannot extrapolate the terrain outside the convex hull delimited by the ground points since there are no triangle facets outside the convex hull. Moreover, the interpolation is weak at the edges because large irrelevant triangles are often created. It\u2019s therefore important to compute the triangulation with a buffer to be able to crop the DTM and clear the edge artifacts.</p> <p>To run the interpolation with TIN execute the following code:</p> <pre><code># calculate a digital terrain model from the classified\n# ground points.

The only thing we can see in the figure is that a road is separating the study area into more or less two equally sized parts. The road becomes clearly visible since it is a flat area which interrupts the slightly inclined terrain.

And with height I am referring to the height of objects above the ground and not above sea level. For example, we might want to know how high certain buildings or trees are. With LiDAR data this information can be easily obtained for large areas and with a very good precision of a few centimeters. To convert a standard LiDAR point cloud to a normalized point cloud in which the Z value of each LiDAR point indicates the height of the point above ground, we can simply subtract the digital terrain model from the LiDAR point cloud.</p> <p>To accomplish this in lidR - there are two different approaches. One approach requires a DTM. For example we can use the DTM calculated with the kriging approach:</p> <pre><code># create a normalized height point cloud\n# by subtracting the digital terrain model from the\n# lidar point cloud\nnlas &lt;- las - dtm_kriging\n</code></pre> <p>We can then plot the resulting point cloud and compare it with the original point cloud by plotting</p> <pre><code># plot the result\nplot(nlas, size = 4, bg = \"white\")\n# and compare it to the original point cloud\nplot(las, size = 4, bg = \"white\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in two individual plots, which were merged into one in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>We can clearly see the difference. While in the original point cloud, the height differences between the trees are less clear due to slope which also exists in the plot, the height differences become clearly visible in the normalized point cloud which all stand on a \"flat\" ground.</p> <p>One consequence of the normalization of the point cloud should be that all LiDAR points classified as ground points should have a Z-value 0 m. With the following plot we can have a look whether this is true:</p> <pre><code># this should lead to a situation where all ground points\n# have a value of 0.0 m. We can check this with the following \n# command. Be aware that this a nested function. That is, the\n# hist() command is used to create a histogram and the filter_ground()\n# command is used to only show values for point classified as\n# ground in the codeparts before and the $Z is used to only\n# show height values. The breaks command decides how fine the\n# individual bars of the histogram are - this could also be left\n# out. The dev.off() command is used to close any plot that is still\n# open.\ndev.off()\nhist(filter_ground(nlas)$Z, breaks = seq(-0.6, 0.6, 0.01), main = \"\", xlab = \"Elevation\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that the assumption is more or less true but we can also see that the ground points are not all exactly at 0 m but they fluctuate between roughly -0.5 and 0.5 m. This is related to the fact that we used an interpolated DTM with a given grid size. Within a single grid cell of the DTM, the height value is exactly the same in each location of the grid cell. Hence, some ground points may lay below or above this value.</p> <p>If we want all ground points to have a value of zero, lidR offers a function to normalize the point cloud using the ground points without a grid-based interpolation. There are still some interpolation going on for the non-ground points but all ground-points will have a value of zero.

In the case of a normalized point cloud, the derived surface represents the canopy height (for vegetated areas) and is referred to as CHM. When the original (non-normalized) point cloud with absolute elevations is used, the derived layer represents the elevation of the top of the canopy above sea level, and is referred to as DSM. Both surface models are derived using the same algorithms, with the only difference being the elevation values of the point cloud.</p> <p>Different methods exist to create DSMs and CHMs. In the most simple case, a grid can be created with a user-defined pixel size and the elevations of the highest point can be assigned to each grid cell. This is called point-to-raster. </p> <p>Point-to-raster algorithms are conceptually simple, consisting of establishing a grid at a user defined resolution and attributing the elevation of the highest point to each pixel. Algorithmic implementations are computationally simple and extremely fast. In the first example we will set the pixel size to 1 and the corresponding algorithm = p2r():</p> <pre><code># point-to-raster method\nchm &lt;- rasterize_canopy(las, res = 0.5, algorithm = p2r())\ncol &lt;- height.colors(25)\nplot(chm, col = col)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p> </p> <p>As we can see the depicted height values are still showing altitudes above sea level. Hence, while we do see height differences of more than 60 m in the study area, not all of these height differences are related to the height of trees. So this would be an example of a \"digital elevation model\" (DSM) which is a raster which shows the height above sea level of the ground + the objects on the ground at each spatial location. If we are interested in only seeing the height of objects we need a \"normalized digital elevation model\" (nDSM) or in the case of forests a so called \"canopy height model\" (CHM). This created by either subtracting the a DTM from a DSM of the same area. Or by directly applying the same algorithm as used for calculating the DSM but this time to the already normalized point cloud:</p> <pre><code># point-to-raster method\nchm &lt;- rasterize_canopy(nlas, res = 0.5, algorithm = p2r())\ncol &lt;- height.colors(25)\nplot(chm, col = col)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p> </p> <p>In some cases, the point-to-raster method has some drawbacks. For example if you have a LiDAR dataset with comparably few number of returns, you might end up with data caps in your elevation model. One alternative approach to calculate the DSMs and nDSMs is the TIN approach we already used to calculate DTMs.</p> <p>The triangulation algorithm works by first creating a triangular irregular network (TIN) using first returns only, followed by interpolation within each triangle to compute an elevation value for each pixel of a raster. In its simplest form, this method consists of a strict 2-D triangulation of first returns. Despite being more complex compared to the point-to-raster algorithm, an advantage of the triangulation approach is that it is parameter free and it does not output empty pixels, regardless of the resolution of the output raster (i.e. the entire area is interpolated).</p> <p>Like point-to-raster however, the TIN method can lead to gaps and other noise in the surface - referred to as \u201cpits\u201d - that are attributable to first returns that penetrated deep into the canopy. Pits can make individual tree segmentation more difficult and change the texture of the canopy in a unrealistic way. To avoid this issue the CHM is often smoothed in post processing in an attempt to produce a more realistic surface with fewer pits and less noise. To create a surface model using triangulation we use algorithm = dsmtin().</p> <pre><code># tin method\nchm &lt;- rasterize_canopy(las, res = 0.5, algorithm = dsmtin())\nplot(chm, col = col)\n</code></pre> <p>This results in the following plot:</p> <p> </p> <p>In our dataset, the differences are quite little. </p> <p>We are now coming towards the end of this tutorial and so far you have learned the most important basic processing steps for LiDAR / laserscanning data.

In the latter, the basic unit of the analysis is a cell of a user-defined fixed size (e.g., 20 x 20 m). In the individual tree-based approach, the basic unit of the analysis is a single tree. Automatically delineating trees from a LiDAR point cloud is an own field of research and we will not go into details in this tutorial. However, the lidR package offers one standard algorithm to identify tree tops from a LiDAR point cloud which will be briefly explained below.</p> <p>Tree tops can be detected by applying a Local Maximum Filter (LMF) on the loaded data set. The LMF in lidR is point cloud-based, meaning that it finds the tree tops from the point cloud without using any raster. The processing, however is actually very similar. For a given point, the algorithm analyzes neighbourhood points, checking if the processed point is the highest. This algorithm can be applied with the  Local Maximum Filter - lmf() function.</p> <p>The LMF can be applied with a constant size windows. In the code below with a windows size of ws = 5 meters meaning that for a given point the algorithm looks to the neigbourhood points within a 2.5 radius circle to figure out if the point is the local highest. While the algorithm does not need any CHM to work we chose to display the results on top of a CHM for better visualization.</p> <pre><code># detect tree tops with fixed window size of 5\nttops &lt;- locate_trees(nlas, lmf(ws = 5))\n\n# have a look at results\nchm &lt;- rasterize_canopy(nlas, res = 0.5, algorithm = p2r())\nplot(chm, col = height.colors(50))\nplot(sf::st_geometry(ttops), add = TRUE, pch = 3)\n</code></pre> <p>This will take some time for processing and then result in the following plot:</p> <p> </p> <p>We can also have a loot at the result in 3D:</p> <pre><code># have a look at results in 3d\nx &lt;- plot(nlas, bg = \"white\", size = 4)\nadd_treetops3d(x, ttops)\n</code></pre> <p> </p> <p>If we are not happy with the results of this comparably simple approach, we can refine the algorithm by adjusting the search window depending on the height of the canopy assuming the trees which are less tall, also have smaller crowns. This can be accomplished by providing the algorithms with a function that describes the relation between the height of the trees and the window size and a sequence of heights for which different window sizes will be used:</p> <pre><code># adapt window size with height\nf &lt;- function(x) {x * 0.1 + 3}\nheights &lt;- seq(0,40,10)\nws &lt;- f(heights)\nplot(heights, ws, type = \"l\", ylim = c(0,6))\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in slightly different results:</p> <pre><code>ttops &lt;- locate_trees(nlas, lmf(f))\nplot(chm, col = height.colors(50))\nplot(sf::st_geometry(ttops), add = TRUE, pch = 3)\n</code></pre> <p> </p> <p>Identifying the optimal parameter is not an easy task and may require some sort of reference data which can for example be obtained by visually interpreting a CHM or by identifying tree stem positions in the field. Even though the latter is often also prone to errors since identifying the exact position of a tree in the field is not a trivial task and on top of this, the stem position on the ground may not directly related to the top of the crown since many trees do not grow exactly vertically.</p> <p>The detection of tree tops is normally only the first step for the individual tree delineation/segmentation since it does not yet allow us to identify the tree crown area. lidR provides function for this task as well, but we will not demonstrate this here with our example dataset. Amongst others because our dataset is missing a coordinate reference system (which first would have to be assigned) and the functions will not immediately work. However, feel free to also try out these functions by using the example datasets delivered with lidR.

Then, in each grid-cell/polygon some metrics are calculated for the points located within the grid-cell/polygon. </p> <p>The standard deviation of point heights within a single tree crown is an example of a metric calculated at the tree level. The average distance between a point and its k-nearest neighbours is a metrics calculated at the point level.

In the case of remote sensing data, most of the time, the observations are not regular. Even though the satellite typically passes over a certain area at a fixed time interval, cloud cover prevents that the satellite collects a valid observation during every overflight. Hence, remote sensing time series often have data gaps and hence an irregular structure. In the case of Landsat data, we furthermore have data from several sensors, so that the time structure is at least for some periods even less regular.</p> <p>In this first step of the tutorial, we will learn how to transform an irregular time series to a regular time series. We will first load the irregular time series from our MODIS dataset, then we will transform this time series to a daily time-series and finally aggregate it again to a weekly time series. To do this, we require several packages and an additional function which was suggested by my colleague Philipp G\u00c3\u00a4rtner. You can find some related information here:</p> <p>https://philippgaertner.github.io/2018/04/bfast-preparation/#</p> <p>So let's have a look at the packages we will use during this tutorial:</p> <pre><code>require(raster)\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(zoo)\nrequire(bfast)\nrequire(xts)\n</code></pre> <p>The bfastSpatial package is not on the official CRAN list of R, so we will have to install the package manually using:</p> <pre><code>library(devtools)\ninstall_github('loicdtx/bfastSpatial')\n# load the package\nlibrary(bfastSpatial)\n</code></pre> <p>you can find more information about this package here:</p> <p>http://www.loicdutrieux.net/bfastSpatial/</p> <p>I hope the installation of bfastSPatial will work smoothly - I experienced some troubles with this earlier but this time I had no issues. Besides the packages, we will need a custom function which I copied from the link of Philipp's webpage above. We should run this code to make the function available:</p> <pre><code>aggregate.daily.to.weekly &lt;- function(daily.ts) {\n\n  dates      &lt;- as.Date(date_decimal(as.numeric(time(daily.ts))))\n  xts.daily  &lt;- xts(daily.ts, order.by = dates)\n  xts.weekly &lt;- round(xts::apply.weekly(xts.daily, median),0)  # xts\n\n  start(xts.weekly)\n  ts.weekly &lt;- ts(data = xts.weekly, \n                  # define the start and end (Year, Week)    \n                  start = c(as.numeric(format(start(xts.weekly), \"%Y\")),\n                            as.numeric(format(start(xts.weekly), \"%W\"))), \n                  end   = c(as.numeric(format(end(xts.weekly), \"%Y\")), \n                            as.numeric(format(end(xts.weekly), \"%W\"))), \n                  frequency = 52)\n\n  return(ts.weekly)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>After running the function, it will be available in our workspace and also be listed in the environment shown in RStudio:</p> <p></p> <p>Now we will load the MODIS raster dataset and the corresponding dates as we already did in the first time-series analysis Tutorial:</p> <pre><code>###\n# load raster-stacks exported from the Google Earth Engine\n###\n\n# set working directory\nsetwd(\"D:/Multiskalige_FE/5_Practicals/Tag_8_bfast\")\n\n# load MODIS NDVI time series with images from 2000-2020\nmod_ndvi &lt;- brick(\"MODIS_all_00_20_sm.tif\")\n\n###\n# load corresponding dates of the time series\n###\n\n# MODIS\nm_dat &lt;- read.table(\"dates_mod.txt\")\nm_dat_fin &lt;- m_dat[seq(2, nrow(m_dat),2),]\nm_dat_fin2 &lt;- as.character(m_dat_fin)\nm_dat_for &lt;- as.Date(m_dat_fin2, format = c(\"%Y%m%d\"))\n</code></pre> <p>Now we are all set for conducting our time-series analysis. First, we extract again the NDVI time series of an individual pixel:</p> <pre><code># MODIS (here, row 3, column 32)\nm_ts &lt;- as.vector(mod_ndvi[3,32])\n# set values of 0 to NA (masked pixels in this MODIS dataset have a value of 0)\nm_ts[m_ts==0] &lt;- NA\n</code></pre> <p>Then we create a daily time-series using the NDVI values and the corresponding dates. Be aware that we are using a special function of the bfastSpatial package to create the daily time series. This is necessary as the other packages do now allow us to transform an irregular time series with a periodicity longer than a day to a daily time series. Basically, the function \"bfastts\" just adds empty observation for each day to get a complete daily time-series (see figure below). While this process seems quite straightforward in this tutorial, I would like to mention that the bfastts() function is still a bit of a prototype and while it works fine with the MODIS data of this tutorial, I had troubles running it for the Landsat-based dataset we used in the other Tutorials. I think it has something to do with the doubling of some acquisition dates due to the simultaneous acquisitions of multiple Landsat satellites, but I did not figure out a solution, yet. So far, the work-flow in this tutorial is hence only working for the MODIS dataset.</p> <pre><code>###\n# create time series objects \n###\n\n# create daily time series object\nmod_ts &lt;- bfastts(as.vector(m_ts), m_dat_for, type = c(\"irregular\"))\nmod_ts\n</code></pre> <p>This will lead to the following object:</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we interpolate the time series and have a look at it:</p> <pre><code># interpolate time series\nmod_ts_ip &lt;- round(na.approx(mod_ts),0)\n\n# plot the resulting time series\nplot(mod_ts_ip)\n</code></pre> <p>This results in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>Now we are already almost ready to run bfast.

In the BFAST algorithm several parameters have to be defined. We can have a look at the help of the bfast function to find a bit more about the settings:</p> <pre><code>?bfast\n</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately, the information given in the help is comparably sparse - it might hence be valuable to also read the two papers in which BFAST is described with more details. One key-setting is the \"h\" parameter which defines how large the time-difference between two breakpoint has to be at least before a second breakpoint can be detected. From the limited experience I have with BFAST in practice, I know that the h parameter has a quite notable impact on the results. However, unfortunately, I do not have a good general recommendation how to set it. It might be worthwhile to have a closer look at the literature about this. The other important settings are \"season\". This defines which model will be used to fit the seasonal (phenological) cycle which is inherent in most vegetation datasets. In case there is now clear seasonal cycle observable in the study area of interest (e.g., in the tropics), this parameter can be set to \"none\". Otherwise, the standard setting \"harmonic\" should work well in most cases. Finally, another important parameter is \"breaks\" which defines the maximum number of break points that should be detected by BFAST. In our example, we set this to 2. The decision about the number of breakpoints has to be taken based on the knowledge of the ecosystem under study. Typically, ecosystems experience heavy disturbances in a certain time-interval which might be quite large. So given the maximal length of current remote sensing time series (approximately 40 years), in most ecosystems, we cannot expect more then 2 or maybe 3-4 disturbances. Here, we have a MODIS time series of 20 years and hence I decided to set the number of disturbances to two.</p> <p>So let's run the algorithm:</p> <pre><code>bfm2 &lt;- bfast(mod_ts_ip2[,1], h = 10/length(mod_ts_ip2[,1]), \n         season = \"harmonic\", breaks = 2, max.iter = 2)\n</code></pre> <p>You will see that even running BFAST for a single pixel, takes quite a bit of time (depending on your computer  and depending also on the properties of the selected pixels several seconds, up to 1-2 minutes is realistic). </p> <p>After the code has run, we can have a look at the results by running:</p> <pre><code>plot(bfm2)\n</code></pre> <p>This will results in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>We can see, that for the current pixel, BFAST detected two break points which are rather close together in time. Whether these are real breakpoints can be discussed. They might also be related to an artefact in the time series. At least at first glance, the overall impression is not that of a clear drop.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to have a closer look at the graph as it describes quite well how BFAST works. On the top panel, we can see the original time series. In the second panel from the top, we can see the seasonal model that was fitted by BFAST. In the third panel, we can see the linear trend components which are fitted separately for each continuous segment between breakpoints. The last, bottom panel shows the residuals which are not explained by the seasonal and the trend component together.</p> <p>You can now re-run the bfast function and have a look how for example changing the number of breaks or the h parameter influences the results and maybe also rerun the algorithm for some other pixels. This is good for getting a feeling how variable the results can be which is important if BFAST is used for an analysis over a larger area and the final, often summarized, results have to be interpreted.</p> <p>One more important point is to access some key-results contained in the bfast object created by the bfast() function. Two pieces of information that can be accessed quite easily is the magnitude and the time-point of the largest breakpoint. This can be achieved by running:</p> <pre><code>bfm2$Magnitude\nbfm2$Time\n</code></pre> <p>Which will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>This can be interpreted that we had a drop in NDVI of 1709 (0.1709) as compared to the expected value at the 605th value of our time series.

This summary is accomplished by calculating a kernel-density-map in which for each date within a year, the probability of a given time-series value is defined.</p> <p>This sounds quite abstract, but if you go back to the theoretical lectures and check the corresponding graphs, the idea becomes quite clear. You can also find more information about NPPHEN in the manuscript of Estay &amp; Chavez provided on ILIAS and here:</p> <p>http://www.pucv.cl/uuaa/site/edic/base/port/uuaa/labgrs/proyectos/introduction-to-npphen-in-r/2018-06-27/114109.html</p> <p>I would like to point out at the beginning, that the NPPHEN package is still under development. I came across some issues which I will also mention below, that make me doubt a bit the conducted analysis of some of the functions. As I still like the basic idea behind the package, I am still presenting the functionalities below, but this should all be considered carefully. In case someone would like to use this approach for a real analysis, I would highly recommend to re-check the source code of the package. I had a quick look and it does not seem to be that complex.</p> <p>The first part of the code is almost identical to the BFAST code - we load the required packages, define the additional function to convert daily time series to weekly time series, we load the MODIS data and extract the time series for a single pixel:</p> <pre><code>aggregate.daily.to.weekly &lt;- function(daily.ts) {\n\n  dates      &lt;- as.Date(date_decimal(as.numeric(time(daily.ts))))\n\n  xts.daily  &lt;- xts(daily.ts, order.by = dates)\n\n  xts.weekly &lt;- round(xts::apply.weekly(xts.daily, median),0)  # xts\n\n  start(xts.weekly)\n  ts.weekly &lt;- ts(data = xts.weekly, \n                  # define the start and end (Year, Week)    \n                  start = c(as.numeric(format(start(xts.weekly), \"%Y\")),\n                            as.numeric(format(start(xts.weekly), \"%W\"))), \n                  end   = c(as.numeric(format(end(xts.weekly), \"%Y\")), \n                            as.numeric(format(end(xts.weekly), \"%W\"))), \n                  frequency = 52)\n\n  return(ts.weekly)\n}\n\n# load required packages\nrequire(raster)\nrequire(xts)\nrequire(zoo)\nrequire(bfastSpatial)\nlibrary(rgdal)\nlibrary(npphen)\nlibrary(rts)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n###\n# load raster-stacks exported from the Google Earth Engine\n###\n\n# set working directory\nsetwd(\"D:/Multiskalige_FE/5_Practicals/1_GEE_basics_v2\")\n\n# load MODIS time series with images from 2000-2020\nmod_ndvi &lt;- brick(\"MODIS_all_00_20_sm.tif\")\n\n###\n# load corresponding dates of the time series\n###\n\n# MODIS\nm_dat &lt;- read.table(\"dates_mod.txt\")\nm_dat_fin &lt;- m_dat[seq(2, nrow(m_dat),2),]\nm_dat_fin2 &lt;- as.character(m_dat_fin)\nm_dat_for &lt;- as.Date(m_dat_fin2, format = c(\"%Y%m%d\"))\n\n# extract single MODIS pixel (here, row 3, column 32)\nm_ts &lt;- as.vector(mod_ndvi[3,32])\nm_ts[m_ts==0] &lt;- NA\n\n###\n# create time series objects by merging the NDVI time series values with the corresponding dates\n###\n\n# create daily time series\nmod_ts &lt;- bfastts(as.vector(m_ts), m_dat_for, type = c(\"irregular\"))\n\n# interpolate missing values\nmod_ts_ip &lt;- round(na.approx(mod_ts),0) \n# have a look at the time series\nplot(mod_ts_ip)\n\n# aggreate time series to weekly time series\nmod_ts_ip2 &lt;- aggregate.daily.to.weekly(mod_ts_ip)\n</code></pre> <p>So far, the code is more or less identical to the one we used for BFAST. Now we have to extract two input variables from the weekly time series in a format that is compatible to algorithms of the NPPHEN package.</p> <p>First, we extract the weekly NDVI values which is comparably straightforward:</p> <pre><code># extract index values\nndvi.num &lt;- as.vector(mod_ts_ip2[,1])\nndvi.num\n</code></pre> <p>As we can see, this is now really only a vector and not a time series object anymore:</p> <p></p> <p>Next, we have to extract the corresponding dates. The dates have to be a date-vector. I played around a bit with some transformations, and the one that worked for me was this option:</p> <pre><code># extract the dates from the time-series object and covert it to numeric values\nmts &lt;- as.numeric(time(mod_ts_ip2))\n## then retransform them to dates in decimal form\ntms &lt;- date_decimal(mts)\ntms\n</code></pre> <p>This will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>There might be smarter ways for extracting the dates, but this solution worked for me.</p> <p>After this step, we are ready to run the key-functions of the NPPHEN package. The first function will calculate the phenological signal of the complete time series. The main inputs are the ndvi-values we extracted from the MODIS pixels and the dates. Furthermore, we have to define on which hemisphere the study site is located - in our case Northern hemisphere and we hence set h=1. If we would be on the Southerm hemisphere, we would have to set h=2 as the seasons would be turned around. rge defines the value range of the provided time-series values which in our case are NDVI values scaled between 0 and 10000. Finally, we have to define the number of observations for the growing season. This basically tells the algorithm how many observation exist per year. The strange thing about this setting is, however, that only certain values will work. I did not yet find out what is the reason for this, but it seems to be an error in the function to me. The correct value for the standard MODIS 16-days product is 23, if we select this value here, the code runs even though our time series is weekly and we have 52 observations per year. We can also change the number to 46 and it will also run, and in this case the results will slightly vary. So far I have no explanations for this. The resulting plots are not fully plausible, but we will ignore this for the moment (see the tutorial linked on ILIAS where you can see how a typical result should look like). I will try to contact the developers of NPPHEN and ask them how they explain this. To produce the first plot, run the following code:</p> <pre><code># conduct the phenological reconstruction\nphen_1pix &lt;- Phen(ndvi.num, tms, h=1, rge=c(0,10000), nGS = 46)\n# plot the result\nplot(phen_1pix)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in this graph:</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that the beginning of the phenological curve seems plausible, but the end of the curve seems incomplete. Given the fact that there should be 52 instead of 46 observation, this somehow makes sense.</p> <p>The current plot is only showing the mean NDVI values for the different time periods of the year. Next we will calculate and examine the kernel density plot where we can see the probabilities of certain NDVI values over the phenological year:</p> <pre><code># kernel density of the reconstructed phenology (for a numerical vector)\nPhenKplot(ndvi.num, tms,h=1,nGS=23, xlab=\"Day of the growing season\",ylab=\"EVI\", rge=c(0,10000))\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>We can also see in this plot that the shape of the curve is not fully plausible, but again, I will have to further examine this and I cannot deliver a good explanation at this point.</p> <p>Finally, we can use NPPHEN to calculate anomalies for a given time-period in comparison to a reference time period. For this we use the \"PehnAnoma()\" function. We again have to define the input time-series values, the dates and the hemisphere. Then, we can define a certain time period as reference time-period and a second period as the one in which anomalies will be identified. Here, I selected the time period from the start of the time-series until the end of the year 2015 as reference period and the last part of the time series will be checked for anomalies. This is all not very comfortable at the moment, as the user has to define the time-points himself by checking which id of the vector corresponds to which date. In my case, you can see for example that tms[824] is the last observation of 2015 and tms[826] is the first observation of 2016.</p> <pre><code>tms[824]\ntmx[825]\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>Ok, so lets run the code:</p> <pre><code>ano_GS16_1pix &lt;- PhenAnoma(ndvi.num, tms,h=1,refp=c(1:824), anop=c(825:1048), rge=c(0,10000)) \nplot(ano_GS16_1pix)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>In this plot, the anomalies for the examined time-periods can be checked - however, the fact that there is a rather regular up- and down pattern makes me worry, that these results might not be fully correct. </p>"},{"location":"BFAST/BFAST/#additional-time-series-functionalities","title":"Additional time series functionalities","text":"<p>While putting together the material for this Tutorial, I came across another r-package named \"greenbrown\" that could be interesting for those who became more interested in time-series analysis during the last weeks.

The GEE is an online platform developed and hosted by Google which provides several very interesting opportunities for conducting geospatial analyses using remote sensing and other geodata. The idea of the platform is that most of the data (particularly data with large file sizes) is already available directly on the platform and that the user does not have to download the files before processing. Furthermore, the GEE also provides processing power directly in the online platform. That means, it is not only possible to access large amounts of geodata online but it is also possible to directly work with the data in the google cloud. The big advantage of this is, is quite obvious. This constellation allows users such as scientists to process huge amounts of data with a super-computer which may not be available at their university and for sure not at their institute. The only thing that is required to access the GEE is a computer with internet access.</p> <p>While this sounds great at the beginning, there are also some shortcomings to this system. At the moment the GEE is by far not offering as many algorithms as for example R. However, Google offers an interface to Python which provides a similar amount of algorithms as R with direct access to the GEE and a lot of opportunities to work with the data. A second problem is that even though the service is free at the moment, this philosophy could change any moment- in case Google simply decides to not longer provide the GEE services for free. Another small issue is, that for downloading the processed data, it is required to have a Google Drive which in the cost-free version has limited storage space. Hence for processing large dataset, it might be necessary to sign-up for plans with extended data volume to download the results and hence some costs will be created by processing within the GEE. However, for the exercises we will conduct in this course, a normal google account should be sufficient to download the results.</p>"},{"location":"MSRS_1_GEE_basics/MSRS_1_GEE_basics/#dataset-in-the-gee","title":"Dataset in the GEE","text":"<p>An overview over the geo-datasets that are directly available in the GEE can be found here:</p> <p>https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets</p> <p>This should lead you to a webpage hat looks like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Take some time to browse the data catalogue!

Most of the data are not only available as raw data but also as higher-level data.

We can also not define a folder, then the image will simply be exported to the parent folder of the Google Drive. Once you are happy with your settings click \"RUN\" and then you will have to wait a few minutes or up to a few hours (if the data is large) until the data appears in your Google Drive. In this example a file named \"MODIS_all_00_20_sm.tif\" will occur in your google drive. If you are not sure how to access your Google drive, please google it. Should be very easy to find.

The two text-files containing the image acquisition dates for MODIS and Landsat should also be in the same folder.</p>"},{"location":"MSRS_1_GEE_basics/MSRS_1_GEE_basics/#step-6-exploring-the-exported-data-in-r","title":"Step 6: Exploring the exported data in R","text":"<p>As final step in this tutorial, we will load the NDVI raster-stacks exported from the GEE in R and create time-series by merging the NDVI values with the image acquisition dates stored in the text-files. We will need the exported raster-files and the text-files. So please make sure that you have all data stored in a folder and know where this folder is.</p> <p>Next, we open RStudio and load the required packages:</p> <pre><code># load required packages\nrequire(raster)\nrequire(xts)\nrequire(zoo)\n</code></pre> <p>In case some packages are missing, please install them (you should know how to do this by now, if not, please check the older Tutorials). Next, we will load the raster-files containing the MODIS and Landsat time series:</p> <pre><code>###\n# load raster-stacks exported from the Google Earth Engine\n###\n\n# set working directory\nsetwd(\"D:/Multiskalige_FE/5_Practicals/1_GEE_basics_v2\")\n# load Landsat time series with images from 1986-2020\nls_ndvi &lt;- brick(\"LS_NDVI_all_86_20.tif\")\nnlayers(ls_ndvi)\n# load MODIS time series with images from 2000-2020\nmod_ndvi &lt;- brick(\"MODIS_all_00_20_sm.tif\")\nnlayers(mod_ndvi)\n</code></pre> <p>Be aware, that this time, we use the brick() command instead of the stack() command to load the raster files. This command will allow to access the raster-files in a slightly different way which increases the speed to access all raster-layers of an individual pixel (which in our case refers to a time-series). If you want to see the difference, you can re-run the code using the stack() command instead of the brick() command and you will see that one of code lines will run very slow (find out which one if you are interested!).</p> <p>After loading the raster stacks, we will also load the text-files containing the image acquisition dates, we copy &amp; pasted from the GEE console. We will use the following code to do this:</p> <pre><code>###\n# load corresponding dates of the time series\n###\n\n# Landsat\n\n# read table\nls_dat &lt;- read.table(\"dates_ls.txt\")\n# drop every second line (containing only the id)\nls_dat_fin &lt;- ls_dat[seq(2, nrow(ls_dat),2),]\n# transform remaining rows from factor to character\nls_dat_fin2 &lt;- as.character(ls_dat_fin)\n# transform character-expression to dates\nls_dat_for &lt;- as.Date(ls_dat_fin2, format = c(\"%Y%m%d\"))\n\n# MODIS\n\n# read table\nm_dat &lt;- read.table(\"dates_mod.txt\")\n# drop every second line (containing only the id)\nm_dat_fin &lt;- m_dat[seq(2, nrow(m_dat),2),]\n# transform remaining rows from factor to character\nm_dat_fin2 &lt;- as.character(m_dat_fin)\n# transform character-expression to dates\nm_dat_for &lt;- as.Date(m_dat_fin2, format = c(\"%Y%m%d\"))\n</code></pre> <p>Be aware that R has an own data-type for dates. To transform the entries of the text-files into a vector containing only dates, we have to follow several processing steps as indicated in the code above. First we load the text-file into a variable. In this stage, the imported file looks like this:</p> <p></p> <p>That is, we  have the ID in one row and the actual acquisition dates in the format: YYYYMMDD in every second row. Hence, we are only interested in every second row of our variable. That is we we run the code:</p> <pre><code>ls_dat_fin &lt;- ls_dat[seq(2, nrow(ls_dat),2),]\n</code></pre> <p>which will then lead to the following output:</p> <p></p> <p>We now only have the acquisition dates in the variable, but as we can see the current vector is still in the wrong format. The information on \"Levels\" indicates that the data type of the vector is currently \"factor\". We hence first transform the vector to \"character\" and then to a \"date\" vector using the lines:  </p> <pre><code># transform remaining rows from factor to character\nls_dat_fin2 &lt;- as.character(ls_dat_fin)\n# transform character-expression to dates\nls_dat_for &lt;- as.Date(ls_dat_fin2, format = c(\"%Y%m%d\"))\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we have prepared the acquisition dates in a way, so that they can be used to create time-series objects. But before we will do this, we will have a quick look at the raster data we exported from the Google Earth Engine. We will use a for-loop to plot some of the NDVI images of the time series. We will not plot all images, as this would take a really long time (particularly for the Landsat data which generally requires a lot more time to plot the individual NDVI images). Be aware that you can stop the ploting-loop at any time by pressing the little \"stop\" button in RStudio. We will plot 10 of the Landsat scenes and 40 of the MODIS scenes. Depending on the speed of your computer this may take a while. Have a look at the images that appear and reflect what you are seeing.</p> <pre><code>###\n# have a brief look on the data by plotting the individual time series\n# raster of MODIS and some selected scenes of Landsat\n###\n\n# plot selected Landsat NDVI rasters\n\nfor(i in 420:430){\n\n  plot(ls_ndvi[[i]], main=ls_dat_for[i], zlim=c(-0.5,1))\n\n}\n\n# plot MODIS NDVI rasters\n\nfor(i in 1:40){\n\n  plot(mod_ndvi[[i]], main=m_dat_for[i], zlim=c(-5000,10000))\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Probably most of you observed at least two things: 1. The plotted raster data in many cases showed data gaps with NA or 0 values; 2. The NDVI images show quite clear seasonal signals with a lot more positive NDVI values during the summer months. Both of these observations are quite typical for dense time series of remote sensing data. Due to cloud cover and snow, there are many missing values included. Particularly, if no temporal mosaicing is conducted. The latter we will learn next week. We will now have a closer look at the seasonal signal by plotting NDVI time series of individual pixels. To do this, we first extract the complete NDVI time series of one MODIS and one Landsat pixel:</p> <pre><code>###\n# extract NDVI time series for individual pixels\n###\n\n# extract Landsat pixel (here row 45, column 56)\nls_ts &lt;- as.vector(ls_ndvi[45,56])\n\n# MODIS (here, row 1, column 1)\nm_ts &lt;- as.vector(mod_ndvi[1,1])\nm_ts[m_ts==0] &lt;- NA\n</code></pre> <p>You could easily modify the codes above to select different pixels and explore how the corresponding time-series look like. In case of the MODIS pixels, a value of 0 indicates a masked pixel which had a low data quality due to cloud-cover or snow. We hence set al values of 0 to NA.</p> <p>Next, we will create time series objects. Time series objects are a special kind of data type in R which typically contain some sort of observational values (in our case NDVI values) and corresponding time stamps (which in our case were prepared from the text files as described above). There are different packages in R that allow creating time series objects. Here, we use the xtc package. A summary of the most important xtc commands can be found here:</p> <p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sAe2GalxPk2T3Ce8R53Zz5fqooY9Katt</p> <p>To create the time series object, we first create a dataframe containing the NDVI values of the pixel and the time-stamps and subsequently create the xtc object:</p> <pre><code># prepare dataframe with NDVI values and dates\nls.df &lt;- data.frame(ls_ts, ls_dat_for)\nm.df &lt;- data.frame(m_ts, m_dat_for)\n\n# create time series object\nls.NDVI.ts &lt;- xts(ls.df$ls_ts, order.by=ls.df$ls_dat_for)\nmod.NDVI.ts &lt;- xts(m.df$m_ts, order.by=m.df$m_dat_for)\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we will plot the prepared time-series datasets:</p> <pre><code># plot the time series\nplot(ls.NDVI.ts)\nplot(mod.NDVI.ts)\n</code></pre> <p>This will lead to the following graphs:</p> <p> </p> <p>As we can see, both time series show a quite clear seasonal signal. The MODIS time series is notably shorter than the Landsat time series. Be aware that the two time series do not represent the exact same location and should hence not be directly compared. They are just meant to be a random example. Even though, you could adapt the code and extract a time series for pixels that are actually overlapping. The signal is most likely not directly comparable anyway as the MODIS pixels are a lot bigger than the Landsat pixels (250 m x 250 m vs. 30 m x 30 m). To get a better understanding of how the time series actually looks like, we can interpolate the gaps in the time series using some standard processing options offered by the xtc package:</p> <pre><code>###\n# work with time-series object\n###\n\n# interpolate missing values\n\nls.NDVI.ts.ip &lt;- na.approx(ls.NDVI.ts)\nplot(ls.NDVI.ts.ip)\n\nmod.NDVI.ts.ip &lt;- na.approx(mod.NDVI.ts)\nplot(mod.NDVI.ts.ip)\n</code></pre> <p>Running this code will lead to the two following graphs:</p> <p> </p> <p>The interpolated time series look a lot smoother and it seems even possible to observe some trends in these new graphs. In the NDVI time series there seems to be one outlier in 2016 which does not seem to be very realistic and is most likely some sort of artefact in the raw data which was not detected by the automated pre-processing routines. In both time series, there seems to be an overall trend to increasing NDVI values. We can try to depict this trend a bit clearer by converting the high-frequency time series of approximately one observation every 16 days to an annual time-series. We can do this with the following code:</p> <pre><code># convert time series to yearly values\nls.NDVI.ts.y &lt;- to.yearly(ls.NDVI.ts)\nmod.NDVI.ts.y &lt;- to.yearly(mod.NDVI.ts)\n\n# plot yearly time series\n\nplot(ls.NDVI.ts.y)\nplot(ls.NDVI.ts.y$ls.NDVI.ts.High)\n\nplot(mod.NDVI.ts.y)\nplot(mod.NDVI.ts.y$mod.NDVI.ts.High)\n</code></pre> <p>This will in total lead to four plots:</p> <p> </p> <p>In the first and the third plot here, four trend lines are shown representing the first and the last NDVI value of the corresponding year (black and blue - could not find out yet which one is which) as well as the highest (red line) and lowest NDVI value (green line). In the second and forth plot, only the highest NDVI value of each year are depicted in a trend line. Here, the general increase in NDVI maxima is well depicted for the Landsat pixel, while a similar but weaker trend can be observed for the MODIS pixel.</p>"},{"location":"MSRS_1_GEE_basics/MSRS_1_GEE_basics/#step-7-ilias-exercise-find-a-pixel-with-decreasing-vegetation-trend-or-a-pixel-where-vegetation-disappeared-completely","title":"Step 7: ILIAS Exercise  - find a pixel with decreasing vegetation trend or a pixel where vegetation disappeared completely","text":"<p>You know now, how to extract a NDVI time-series for an individual pixel and we have learned above how to also interpolate and plot the corresponding time series.

The objective of the exercise is to identify a Landsat or a MODIS pixel in which a either a declining NDVI trend can be observed or the trend suggests that a vegetation area (showing the typical seasonal NDVI signal) has been transformed to another land-cover type (for example a comparable stable urban or bare soil signal which should show constantly low NDVI values).

In the following, I will present step-by-step the code and functions that are necessary to derive annual mosaics of Landsat-based NDVI values. The code can of course easily be adapted to derive the same mosaics for other vegetation indices that can be derived from Landsat data.</p> <p>You might remember from last week, that typically the raw Landsat data are pre-processed to eliminate unwanted observation, such as pixels affected by clouds or snow. In this code example, we are working with today, these pre-processing steps are a bit more sophisticated and aside the cloud-mask functions, two more functions are used to eliminated saturated pixels (more than 100% reflectance) and areas affected by large aerosol concentrations. The corresponding functions either directly use the input bands for calculating NDVI (for the saturation function) or the pixel_quality band that is delivered with each atmospherically corrected Landsat scene (and which is avaiable if the surface reflectance products of Landsat are used in GEE). The corresponding codes in the GEE looks like this:</p> <pre><code>//--------------------------------------------//\n// 1. QA FUNCTIONS //\n//--------------------------------------------//\n//SATURATES MASK (L5/7)\nvar maskSaturate57 = function(image){\nimage = image.select('B3', 'B4');\nvar mask = image.lt(10000).and(image.gte(0));\nreturn image.updateMask(mask);\n}\n\n//SATURATES MASK (L8)\nvar maskSaturate8 = function(image){\nimage = image.select('B4', 'B5');\nvar mask = image.lt(10000).and(image.gte(0));\nreturn image.updateMask(mask);\n}\n\n//PIXEL MASK (L8)\nvar maskPixels8 = function(image){\nvar pixel_qa = image.select('pixel_qa');\nvar mask = pixel_qa.eq(322);\nreturn image.updateMask(mask);\n}\n\n//PIXEL MASK (L5/L7)\nvar maskPixels57 = function(image){\nvar pixel_qa = image.select('pixel_qa');\nvar mask = pixel_qa.eq(66);\nreturn image.updateMask(mask);\n}\n\n//AEROSOL MASK (L8)\nvar maskAerosol = function(image){\nvar aero_qa = image.select('sr_aerosol'); var mask = aero_qa.neq(194).and(aero_qa.neq(224)).and(aero_qa.neq(160)).and(aero_qa.neq( 130));\nreturn image.updateMask(mask); } \n//ATMOS OPACITY MASK (L5/L7) -to get rid of haze \nvar maskHaze = function(image){\n//Select band and multiply by scaling factor\nvar atmos_qa = image.select('sr_atmos_opacity').multiply(0.0010);\n//Mask for non-hazy pixels and remove fill vals\nvar mask = atmos_qa.lte(0.1).and(atmos_qa.gt(-9.9));\nreturn image.updateMask(mask)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The next function are required for calculating the NDVI for Landsat 5,7 and 8 images:</p> <pre><code>//----------------------------------------------//\n// 2. NDVI FUNCTIONS //\n//----------------------------------------------//\n//NDVI FUNCTIONS\nvar getNDVI57 = function(image) {\n//Apply saturate function\nimage = maskSaturate57(image);\nvar nir = image.select('B4');\nvar red = image.select('B3');\nvar ndvi = nir.subtract(red).divide(nir.add(red)).rename('nd');\nreturn(ndvi);\n}\nvar getNDVI8 = function(image){ \n  //Apply saturate function \n  image = maskSaturate8(image); \n  var nir = image.select('B5'); \n  var red = image.select('B4'); \n  var ndvi = nir.subtract(red).divide(nir.add(red)).rename('nd'); \n  return(ndvi);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>These kind of functions should already look more or less familiar from last week's tutorial. One difference in comparison to last week is, that the bands are pre-processed wth the saturation function defined above, to avoid calculating the NDVI for pixels with impossible reflectance values.</p> <p>The next function addresses a known issue of the Landsat family: The bands of Landsat 5, 7 and 8 are all slightly shifted in terms of the spectral range. Hence, the NDVI values calculated for Landsat 5, 7 and 8 would not be completely identical even if they would observe exactly the same situation on the ground at the same time and under the exactly same conditions. The difference are not huge, but nevertheless they are there and some correction coefficents have been suggested to correct these differences between the NDVIs. The function below does exactly this to calibrate LS 8 and LS 5 values to LS 7:</p> <pre><code>//-----------------------------------------------//\n// 3. SENSOR CALLIBRATION FUNCTIONS //\n//-----------------------------------------------//\n//Coefficient Function (L5)\nvar applyCoefficientL5 = function(image){\nvar image_adjusted = image.select('nd').multiply(1.036);\nreturn(image_adjusted); } \n//Coefficient Function (L8) \nvar applyCoefficientL8 = function(image){\nvar image_adjusted = image.select('nd').multiply(1.0863);\nreturn(image_adjusted); }\n</code></pre> <p>After briefly explaining these helper-functions, we will not concentrate on the main function to create the annual NDVI mosaics.

The code has been mostly prepared by Krystal Lan (lan.krystalt@gmail.com) and Ryan Whaley (rdgwhaley@gmail.com). I changed and added a few lines here and there.</p> <p>First, we will load all the packages required for analysing our annual NDVI datasets. Please install the packages in case you do not already have them installed:</p> <pre><code># load all required packages\nrequire(raster)\nrequire(rkt)\nrequire(trend)\nrequire(zoo)\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we can set some global raster options which are quite useful. I do not typically use these settings but as it was included in the original code and I found the settings useful, I thought it makes sense to also keep them in the Tutorial:</p> <pre><code>rasterOptions(maxmemory=1e+06, chunksize=1e+07, progress = 'text')\n</code></pre> <p>With this commant, it is possible to change the general settings of the raster package, in this case two settings are referring to how the raster package handles memory (maximum amount of memory used as well as in which chunk size data is loaded when large files are being processed). This settings are quite interesting to adapt the raster package functionalities a bit to the processing power of the computer you are working with. Finally the command \"progress = 'text'\" will make the raster package always inform you about the status of the currently conducted calculation with a progress bar. I think this quite handy, particularly if waiting times sometimes are quite long and you are not sure whether the progress is still working of the computer has crashed.</p> <p>Next, we will load our annual Landsat based NDVI mosaics we just created sing the GEE and apply a Mann-Kendall-trend test to each pixel of our time series. First we load the data and prepare an output folder. We load the data with the command \"brick()\" as this will have some computational advances for some of the functions applied below.</p> <pre><code>##################################\n##MK-test + Seasonal and Regional Kendall tests (SKT / RKT) + Theil-Sen's Slope estimator\n##################################\n# Set working directory (location of rasters)\nsetwd(\"D:/Multiskalige_FE/5_Practicals/Tag_7_time_series\")\n# Set output directory (where the results will go)\nresults &lt;-\"D:/Multiskalige_FE/5_Practicals/Tag_7_time_series/Results\"\n# Stack rasters and then add them to brick\nbricked_files &lt;-brick(\"yearly_LS_ts.tif\")\n</code></pre> <p>Let's first have a look at our image time series by plotting it:</p> <pre><code>x11()\nplot(bricked_files)\n</code></pre> <p>This will results in a plot that looks more or less like this:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, not all of the bands (annual NDVI mosaics) contain data and for some of the years only parts of the study area have observations. For the moment, we will not do anything about this. This is also a somewhat expected outcome of how we calculated our mosaics.</p> <p>Next, we have to define a vector which contains the dates matching the satellite data's acquisition times. In this case a simple numeric vector with the years is sufficient. Even though the bands of the raster stack were renamed in the GEE  (I made some progress since the last Tutorial...), I did not yet find a way to access this information in R. If you load the \"yearly_LS_ts.tif\" in QGIS, you can see that the information is theoretically there:</p> <p></p> <p>However, I still have to figure out how to access these names in R - the typical \"names()\" command shows other filenames. If you have a close look at the Figure above, you will see that for three years of our time series, no mosaic was created. These are the years for which no cloud-free satellite acquisitions were available. So instead of 34 years (1986-2019) we only have 31 years in our time series. We don't have data for the years 1986, 1990 and 1993. We will manually account for this while creating the corresponding vector: </p> <pre><code># Set year range for analysis (number of years have to be the same as number of bands)\nyears2 &lt;-seq(1986, 2019)\nyears &lt;- years2[-c(1,5,8)]\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we will create a function to call the \"rkt()\" function of the rkt package for each pixel in the time series. This is a quite clever way of applying a function that was developed for vector data to a raster file. You will see how this works below. Check also the comments directly in the code. Be aware that our \"years\" variable is hard-coded in the function. So you should not change the variable name above and you should make sure, that the length of the year vector matches the number of bands of your raster file. This is particularly important if you want to apply the code also to other time periods and input data.</p> <pre><code># Analysis function\nrktFun &lt;-function(x) {\n  if(all(is.na(x))){        # if no data is available for the given pixel NA is returned as results\n    c(NA,NA,NA)\n  } else {\n    analysis &lt;-rkt(years, x)    # this executes the rkt function for a NDVI time series of an individual pixel\n    a &lt;-analysis$B # this will extract the results: theil sen slope\n    b &lt;-analysis$sl # this will extract the results: pvalue\n    c &lt;-analysis$tau # this will extract the results: Mann-Kendall tau\n    return(cbind(a, b, c)) # return all results\n  } }\n</code></pre> <p>After defining this function, it can be applied directly to our raster time series by using the following call:</p> <pre><code>rRaster &lt;-calc(bricked_files, rktFun)\n</code></pre> <p>Running the function in this way, will return the results of the rkt function also as raster files. The \"calc()\" function is hence an quite interesting generic tool to apply any type of function to a raster stack.</p> <p>You will see that applying the function to the raster stack will take some time. In case you activated the rasterOptions above, you should see a progress bar.</p> <p>The rkt function applies the Mann-Kendall-trend test to each of pixel and corresponding NDVI time series. As we learned in the theoretical lecture of the time-series chapter, the Mann-Kendall test is a non-parametric test that checks whether there is a monotonic trends in the provided dataset. It basically checks the relationship of the value of each  element of a time series in comparison to its neighbors. If there is a positive monotonic trend, neightbors following a given element in the time series should all have higher values, while elements at an earlier time point in the time series should have lower values. The function delivers three outputs: 1. The Theil-Sen slope (a non parametric approach to calculate the steepness of a trend line in a time series. It is calculated as the median slope of all slopes calculated between all possible point pairs), 2. the p-value which indicates the significance of the trend of the pixel according to the Mann-Kendall-test and finally the 3. the tau-values which indicates how strongly monoton the trend is. Be aware that you can have a very strong monotony in a trend but only a very low slope. This would mean that a value is increasing very stabiliy, but that the increase is very low. On the other hand, you can have a quite high slope but a rather low monotony becausethe curve is going up and down a lot. So the three pieces of information should always be interpreted together.</p> <p>With this three lines of code we save the results to a raster</p> <pre><code># Write to Results folder\nwriteRaster(rRaster[[1]], paste0(results,\"/ts_slope.tif\"), overwrite=T)\nwriteRaster(rRaster[[2]], paste0(results,\"/mk_pvalue.tif\"), overwrite=T)\nwriteRaster(rRaster[[3]], paste0(results,\"/mk_tau.tif\"), overwrite=T)\n</code></pre> <p>We can of course also plot the results:</p> <pre><code>plot(rRaster)\n</code></pre> <p>This will results in the following graph:</p> <p></p> <p>On the top left, we can see the Theil-Sen slope which is slightly positive for many parts of the study area but also shows some areas with strong negative trends. On the top right, we can see the p-values of the Mann-Kendall trend test, which indicate quite low values for most of the study area. Finally, we can see how monoton the trends are as represented in the Mann-Kendall tau value shown in the bottom left panel. In this case, the Theil-Sen slope and the tau values show quite comparable patterns, which indicates that all occurring changes happened rather continuously.</p> <p>In the next step, we will use the calculated p-values to mask out areas for which the identified trends were not significant. For this, we will first create three p-value masks with different significance levels:</p> <pre><code>##################################\n## 5. P-Value Masking ##\n##################################\n# Load tau raster\ntau &lt;-raster(paste0(results, \"/mk_tau.tif\"))\n# Set p-values to create masks for\np_values &lt;-c(0.01, 0.05, 0.1)\n# Loop through p-values, producing a mask for each\nfor(i in 1:length(p_values)){\n  # Load the P-value raster \n  p_value_raster &lt;-raster(paste0(results, \"/mk_pvalue.tif\")) \n  # Select current p-value \n  p_val &lt;-p_values[[i]] \n  # Create string vers for filenaming \n  p_val_str &lt;-gsub(\"\\\\.\", \"\", as.character(p_val)) \n  # Mask \n  p_value_raster[p_value_raster &gt; p_val] &lt;-NA \n  p_masked &lt;-mask(tau, p_value_raster) \n  # Write result \n  writeRaster(p_masked, paste0(results, \"/pvalue_mask\", p_val_str, \".tif\"),\n  overwrite = TRUE)\n# Cleanup\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we can apply the three masks to our Mann Kendall-tau value raster files and save them. In this case, the tau values are further reduced to only areas showing comparably high tau values of greater than 0.4 or smaller than -0.4:</p> <pre><code>#############################################\n## 6. P-Value Masking with Significant Tau ##\n## Note: Must be run after section 5 ##\n#############################################\n\n# Isolate tau values &gt; 0.4 and &lt; -0.4\nsigTau &lt;-raster(paste0(results, \"/mk_tau.tif\"))\nsigTau[sigTau&gt;(-0.4) &amp; sigTau&lt;0.4] &lt;-NA\n# Loop through p-values, producing a mask for each\nfor(i in 1:length(p_values)){\n  # Select current p-value\n  p_val &lt;-p_values[[i]]\n  # Create string vers for filenaming\n  p_val_str &lt;-gsub(\"\\\\.\", \"\", as.character(p_val))\n  # Read current p-value raster\n  p_value_raster &lt;-raster(paste0(results, \"/pvalue_mask\", p_val_str,\".tif\")) \n  # Mask significant tau with p-value raster \n  tau_masked &lt;-mask(sigTau, p_value_raster) \n  # Write result \n  writeRaster(tau_masked, paste0(results, \"/tau_mask\", p_val_str, \".tif\"),\n  overwrite = TRUE) \n}\n</code></pre> <p>To have a look at the last created result (tau values with trends greather than 0.4 and a p-value of smaller than 0.1) we can run:</p> <pre><code>plot(tau_masked)\n</code></pre> <p>This will show the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>The other results were stored to the harddisc and can either be loaded in R again or visualized in QGIS.</p>"},{"location":"MSRS_1_GEE_basics2/MSRS_1_GEE_basics2/#step-3-identify-turning-points","title":"Step 3: Identify turning points","text":"<p>As last step, we will analyse the annual NDVI mosaics to identify turning points using the pettitt-test. The pettitt test is a comparably simple test which is only able to identify the single, strongest turning point in a time series. We will continue using the already loaded datasets in R. To apply the test to the full raster-stack we will follow a different approach this time, as the due to the way the pettitt test is implemented in R, the calc()-function we applied above is not working smoothly with our dataset.</p> <p>However, there is a simple workaround to make test work with our dataset. As first step, we will transform our raster data into a matrix by running</p> <pre><code>vals &lt;- values(bricked_files)\nhead(vals)\n</code></pre> <p>running this code will result in the following output:</p> <p></p> <p>It is not important, that in this case all the values show NaN values, this is simply due to the fact that the borders of the image do not contain (as you can also see in the plots of the study area above). However, what is important to understand is that in the derived variable vals, each row contains the time series of a single pixel. Hence, we can now simply apply the pettitt-test to each of the rows using a for-loop and store the results:</p> <pre><code># create empty matrix to store results\nres &lt;- matrix(nrow=nrow(vals), ncol=2)\n\n# start looping through the pixels \nfor (i in 1:nrow(vals)){\n\n  # get time series of first pixel\n  x &lt;- vals[i,]\n\n  # check if there is data in the pixel\n  if(all(is.na(x))){\n\n    # if not, save NA, NA as result\n    res[i,] &lt;- c(NA,NA)\n\n  } else {\n\n    # if there is data, fill data gaps in the time series using simple interpolation\n    x1 &lt;- na.approx(na.approx(x))\n    # apply the pettitt test\n    analysis &lt;- pettitt.test(x1)\n    # extract the results\n    a &lt;-as.numeric(analysis$estimate)[1] # pettitt test (id at which time step the change occurred)\n    b &lt;-analysis$p.value \n    # save the results\n    res[i,] &lt;- cbind(a, b)\n\n  } \n  # print current iteration\n  print(i)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The next step now is to re-copy the results (which are currently stored in a matrix) into the raster-format to re-construct the spatial information. To do this, we simply copy one of the bands of our time series dataset and the overwrite its values with the results of the pettitt test.</p> <p>For the p-values obtained for the pettitt-test we can do this by running the following code:</p> <pre><code># get a single raster band of the time series (does not matter which one)\npettitt.p.val &lt;- bricked_files[[1]]\n# overwrite the values of the raster band with the p-values obtained for the pettitt-test\n# this step only works because our results file has exactly the same number rows as the\n# raster has pixels\nvalues(pettitt.p.val) &lt;- res[,2]\n# plot the resulting raster\nplot(pettitt.p.val)\n</code></pre> <p>This will lead to the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>We could run the exactly same code to obtain the main result of the pettitt test which is the id of the point in time series at which the turning point was identified. However, the id is currently a value between 1 and 31 (the number of observations in the annual time series of each pixel). More interesting for us would it be to directly have the year in which the change occurred. This requires that we overwrite the ids currently stored in the variable res[,1] with the corresponding years, stored in the \"years\" variable.</p> <p>To accomplish this we run the following code.</p> <pre><code># copy the results concerning turning points in a new variable\nturnp &lt;- res[,1]\n\n# change each of the id values to the corresponding year\nfor (i in 1:length(years)){\n\n  turnp[turnp==i] &lt;- years[i]\n  print(i)\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Subsequently, we follow the same strategy as above for the p-values to copy the final results back into a raster:</p> <pre><code># get a single raster band of the time series (does not matter which one)\npettitt.timep &lt;- bricked_files[[1]]\n# overwrite the pixel values with the results\nvalues(pettitt.timep) &lt;- turnp\n# plot the turning point raster\nplot(pettitt.timep)\n</code></pre> <p>This will results in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, we can mask out all pixels for which the pettitt test was not significant by first creating a p-value mask:</p> <pre><code>mask &lt;- pettitt.p.val &lt; 00.5\nplot(mask)\n</code></pre> <p>Which at the selected p-value looks like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And then apply the mask to the turning point raster:</p> <pre><code>timep_fin &lt;- mask(pettitt.timep, mask, maskvalue=0, updatevalue=NA)\nplot(timep_fin)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the final image of today's Tutorial:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"basic-landsat/basic-landsat/","title":"Basic processing of Landsat data with R","text":"<p>Fabian Fassnacht</p>"},{"location":"basic-landsat/basic-landsat/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>In this lecture you will learn the basic handling of Landsat data (as one example of multispectral satellite data).

There are two basic options for plotting the satellite scene in R. The first option uses the code:</p> <pre><code>plot(ls_d239)\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>In some cases, executing the above code may result in an error message that the margins are too small to plot the data. The solution to this problem is to first open a pop-up plotting window in R and then execute the plot commant. This works by using the following code.</p> <pre><code>x11()\nplot(ls_d239)\n</code></pre> <p>While this plot gives us some information about how the individual bands of the satellite scene look like, they are still somehow disappointing, as we normally would prefer to see a true-color-visualization of the satellite scene. That is, a visualization that imitates the impression that we create with our visual perception.</p> <p>For such a plot we need a different plotting command which is provided by the <code>raster</code> package:</p> <pre><code>plotRGB(ls_d239, r = 3, g = 2, b = 1, stretch = \"hist\")\n</code></pre> <p>The plotRGB command requires several settings as seen in the code. The first variable is the image to be plotted. Then we have to define which bands of the image should be plotted as the three available colors r = red, g = green, b = blue. In our case, we assign the correct Landsat bands to the the corresponding visualization colors. That is, we assign the Landsat band collecting information about light in the red portion of the spectrum to the red visualization, the green Landsat channel to the green visualization and the blue Landsat channel to the blue visualization. Finally, we have to define a method for stretching the image (pixel) values to the available visualization range. In our case we tell the plotting command to use a histogram (\u201chist\u201d) created by a representative sample of pixels of the image to automatically find a suitable stretch-setting. More detailed information about the plotRGB command can be obtained using the help-function of R which can be accessed for the plotRGB command using.</p> <pre><code>?plotRGB\n</code></pre> <p>Running the command with these settings will result in an image as shown below. This image more or less matches our visual perception (that is, what we would see when we would fly across this area with an airplane or a space rocket and the atmosphere would be very clear).</p> <p></p> <p>Such images can directly be interpreted - green areas typically refer to vegetation, blue areas to water and the white areas to snow or in this case clouds.</p> <p>While these settings are great, as we can directly interpret the information, there is one additional combination of bands that is frequently used in studies related to vegetation. As we have learned in the course, vegetation has a very strong reflection in the near-infrared portion of the light. However, so far this information is not used in the visualization as we currently only use the red, the green and the blue channel of the Landsat image. We will now change this by replacing the red-channel with the near-infrared channel, the green with the red channel and the blue with the green channel. The corresponding command looks like this:</p> <pre><code>plotRGB(ls_d239, r = 4, g = 3, b = 2, stretch = \"hist\")\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>In this image, vegetation now appear in red colors while greenish areas indicate areas without vegetation. Water bodies will appear very dark as most of the electromagnet radiation is absorbed by water in the near-infrared portion of the light while the highest reflection of water occurs in the blue channel which is not considered in this visualization option.</p>"},{"location":"basic-landsat/basic-landsat/#exercise-explore-visualization-settings","title":"Exercise: Explore visualization settings","text":"<p>To practise a bit the so far learned commands, try to load the second image provided in the downloaded data (stored in the folder Landsat/D310).

Areas that did not change should have very similar reflectance values and the difference image should hence depict a value close to zero.</p> <p>On the contrary, if changes have occurred, the difference image will depict values that are clearly deviating from zero.</p> <p>So let us try this with our two Landsat images. One thing we have to consider is that we cannot simply substract a complete image from the other but we should rather work on an individual channel level. Here, we will hence first extract the near-infrared (nir) channel of both images and then substract the second image from the first. To extract the nir channel we use:</p> <pre><code>nir_d239 &lt;- ls_d239_clip2[[4]]\nnir_d310 &lt;- d310_masked[[4]]\n</code></pre> <p>By using the doubled squared brackets <code>[[]]</code>, we can access individual bands of a raster stack.

A difference of around -5000 is very remarkable as the overall valid value range of the Landsat data lays between 0 and 10000 (10000 indicating a reflectance of 100% which is normally by far not reached by natural surfaces). If we want to make more details visible in the plot, we also have the option to change the plotted range of values and hence increase the contrast for lower vlaues.</p> <p>We can do this modifying the <code>plot</code>-command. By providing user-defined limits for the z-dimension (=pixel values) we can force the plot command to use its full color range to plot values between the given two values. Values lower than -2000 and higher than 2000 will no further be separable. This results in a new plot which looks like this:</p> <pre><code>plot(nir_diff, range = c(-2000,2000))\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>It now becomes clear that actually quite many areas showed a notable difference between the first and second image as now shown by the green colors which indicate a positive difference in most areas. This seems to be a plausible result as most of our satellite scene is dominated by vegetation and the first image\u2019s acquisition date was day 239 = 27th of August (late summer) and second image\u2019s acquisition date was day 310 = 6th of November (autumn).

In our case, we will apply a very common algorithm called k-means.</p> <p>The function is called <code>kmeans</code> in R and was originally not developed to particularly work with raster data. However, there is a small work-around so that we can still apply it to our datasets. This work-around bases on a transformation of our raster-dataset to a dataframe (a table). Then the kmeans-algorithm is applied to the table, and the results of the clustering are re-transformed to a raster dataset.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start by trying to run the following code, which will convert the raster-object to a data.frame and then run the kmeans-algorithm to classify all pixel-values into 12 classes.

This command is a nested command, we use the <code>values</code>-function to access only the pixel values of the raster-dataset (and ignore the other properties of the raster object), then we apply the <code>is.na</code> function to check for each raster value whether it is NA or not. Finally, we use the <code>table</code>-function to translate the output of the <code>is.na</code>-function (which is table with as many entries as the raster dataset has pixels) into a contingency table that returns to counts of each factor level (in this case there are only two differing values/factors: TRUE and FALSE).</p> <pre><code>table(is.na(values(ls_d239_clip2)))\n</code></pre> <pre><code>  FALSE    TRUE \n3975594 3932880\n</code></pre> <p>So we now know, that the NAs are problematic for the kmeeans algorithm.

But this will be discussed with more details in a later Tutorial.</p> <p>As next step, we will now retransform the classification results of the kmeans-algorithm to a raster image. The easiest way to do this is to overwrite the values of a band from the original image. We can achieve this by first copying a band of the original image into a new variable:</p> <pre><code>class1_out &lt;- ls_d239_clip2[[1]]\n</code></pre> <p>And then overwriting the values of this band with the clustering results.

We will accomplish this using the SDMTools packages and the \"ClassStat\" and the \"PatchStat\" functions. The two functions only require the input raster (expected is a categorical raster file) and a user-defined cellsize, which in our case will be the spatial resolution of the corresponding satellite sensors. We can calculate the landscape metrics by running the following lines:</p> <pre><code># calculate class-stats for each image\nmetr_s2 &lt;- ClassStat(s2_luc, cellsize=10)\nmetr_ls &lt;- ClassStat(ls_luc, cellsize=30)\nmetr_mod250 &lt;- ClassStat(mod250_luc, cellsize=250)\nmetr_mod500 &lt;- ClassStat(mod500_luc, cellsize=500)\n\n# calculate patch-stats for each image\npatch_s2 &lt;- PatchStat(s2_luc, cellsize=10)\npatch_ls &lt;- PatchStat(ls_luc, cellsize=30)\npatch_mod250 &lt;- PatchStat(mod250_luc, cellsize=250)\npatch_mod500 &lt;- PatchStat(mod500_luc, cellsize=500)\n</code></pre> <p>This calculation may take a few seconds. Once they are ready, we will be able to have a look at the calculated metrics and also make some comparisons between the four land-cover maps.</p> <p>First of all we are interested in what kind of metrics were calculated. To see the names and the definitions of the calculated metrics, we can have a look at the details of the applied functions by running the code:</p> <pre><code>?ClassStat\n?PatchStat\n</code></pre> <p>For simply seeing the names of the metrics, we can also run:</p> <pre><code>colnames(metr_s2)\ncolnames(patch_s2)\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let us have a closer look on what has actually been calculated. If we simply run the objects that were created by calling the functions, we can see that all landscape metrics have been calculated for all of the five land-cover classes in the image. Running:</p> <pre><code>metr_s2\n</code></pre> <p>will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>Here, it becomes clear that for each class and landscape metric, a single value is given. Some of the metrics are quite easy to interprete such as \"prop.landscape\" which simply  indicates the fractional cover of the land-cover class in the complete image. Hence, in this case, the values of all five classes should add-up to 1. For understanding also the other metrics, it is recommended to have a closer look at the details provided in the descriptions of the r-package and the citations given there.</p> <p>We will now try to make some comparisons of values between the four input land-cover datasets with varying spatial resolution. To do this, we will create some bar plots. To get the plots, we first have to select which landscape metric we want to have a look at and then the land-cover class for which we want to compare the values:</p> <pre><code>metric=10\nluc_class=2\n</code></pre> <p>Remember, for getting the names of the calculated landscape metrics we can run:</p> <pre><code>colnames(metr_s2)\n</code></pre> <p>If we want to know how the 10th calculated metric is called, we can also run:</p> <pre><code>colnames(metr_sw)[10]\n</code></pre> <p>Now, lets plot some comparative barplots to always compare the values of landscape metric 10 (mean patch area) calculcated for land cover class 2 (water) of Landsat with the three other input datasets:</p> <pre><code># selected metric and class\nmetric=10\nluc_class = 2\n\n# make plots\nx11()\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\nbarplot(c(metr_ls[luc_class,metric], metr_s2[luc_class,metric]), xlab=\"Landsat vs. S2\", main=paste0(colnames(metr_ls)[metric]), cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)\nbarplot(c(metr_ls[luc_class,metric], metr_mod250[luc_class,metric]), xlab=\"Landsat vs. MODIS 250 m\", main=paste0(colnames(metr_ls)[metric]), cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)\nbarplot(c(metr_ls[luc_class,metric], metr_mod500[luc_class,metric]), xlab=\"Landsat vs. MODIS 500 m\", main=paste0(colnames(metr_ls)[metric]), cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that even though we calculated the same metric, for the same class and the same landscape with the same extent, the differences in spatial resolution of the input datasets, leads to quite strong differences in mean patch area. The differences are stronger, the stronger the resolution differences are. However, this of course also depends on the applied metric and land-cover class. You can now try to make some more comparisons, by changing the variables metric and luc_class in the code and then re-run the plot command.</p>"},{"location":"landscape_metrics/landscape_metrics/#step-4-calculate-landscape-metrics-for-a-grid","title":"Step 4: Calculate landscape metrics for a grid","text":"<p>So far, we calculated a single landscape metric for the whole land-cover map. In our case, the landscape is still comparably small in size so calculating a single metric for the whole landscape, may make sense for some applications. However, in many other cases, we might either have a larger landscape at hand or we might be interested to also see how our landscape varies in terms of its metrics at a finer spatial grain as compared to the complete landscape. In the following, we will adjust the code used above to calculate landscape metrics for smaller sub-parts of the land-cover maps.</p> <p>This will require that we put the calculation into a loop and before running this loop we will have to create a  grid with a user-defined grid cell size. In the following, the code will be presented step by step. First we define the grid-cell size:</p> <pre><code># define a tile size for which you want to compute the landscape metrics\ntile_size &lt;- 500\n</code></pre> <p>In our case this would mean 500 m - but this will depend on the applied coordinate reference system. As we are using data in the metric UTM coordinate reference system, the 500 is fine. It would be more complicated when using the geographic coordinate system with Latitude and Longitude as in this case the grid cell size would have to be defined in geographic degrees. Next, we define the input dataset for which we want to create the grid and extract its extent. In this case, we will use the land-cover map derived from Sentinel-2</p> <pre><code># define the land-use map you want to use as input\ninp &lt;- s2_luc\n\n# use extent of raster layer to prepare grid cells\n# with the tile size defined above \ne &lt;- extent(inp)\n\n# check what e looks like by running\ne\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following:</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that the variable e contains the outer margins of our input image with minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, respectively. From this, we will now derive the total width and height of the area the image is covering by running (the results will be in meter as we are in the metric coordinate system):</p> <pre><code># get x and y ranges\nx_ra &lt;- (e[2]-e[1]) \ny_ra &lt;- (e[4]-e[3])\n</code></pre> <p>Then we will set the grid-cell size by assigning the user-defined value from above to two variables, representing the x and y direction. The two variables will be required in the code below. Be aware that we in theory could also use non-quadratic grid cells, but for now, let's just stay with the quadratic cells.</p> <pre><code># set x,y lengths of grid to user defined tile size\nx_r &lt;- tile_size\ny_r &lt;- tile_size\n</code></pre> <p>Now we are ready to run a nested for-loop to create the grid cell coordinates:</p> <pre><code># create list to store the results of the tile coordinates\ncases &lt;- list()\n\n# create coordinates of all tiles\niter=1\nfor (i2 in 1:(floor(x_ra/x_r))) {\n  for (i in 1:(floor(y_ra/y_r))) {\n\n    e &lt;- extent(inp)\n    e[1] &lt;- e[1] + (i2-1)*x_r\n    e[2] &lt;- e[1] + x_r\n    e[3] &lt;- e[3] + (i-1)*y_r\n    e[4] &lt;- e[3] + y_r\n    cases[[iter]] &lt;- c(e[1], e[2], e[3], e[4])\n    iter = iter+1\n  }\n}\n\n# unbind tile coordinate list\ncases2 &lt;- do.call(rbind, cases)\n# asign meaningful colnames\ncolnames(cases2) &lt;- c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\", \"ymin\", \"ymax\")\n# check final coordinate list\nhead(cases2)\n</code></pre> <p>I will not get into details here about what this code is doing exactly, but feel free to explore the code a bit more. In short, this code will return a list of coordinate-sets defining the 500 m grid-cells for which we will calculate our landscape metrics. The last r command in the code head(cases2) will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>So you can see that each row in the \"cases2\"-variable has the same structure as the \"e\" variable from above and basically describes the outer margin of a single grid-cell.</p> <p>OK! Now let's calculate the metrics for the grid. In the following, we will run the code in a parallelized script. This will enable a notably faster processing time, if the computer has more than one cpu/core available. To do this, we only have to change some parts of the code in comparison to a normal for-loop. Again, I will not go into details here, but in case you are interested in how this works exactly, you can get some first information here:</p> <p>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/vignettes/gettingstartedParallel.pdf</p> <p>Now, let us have a look at the code. First, we start the process by initalizing the parallel processing:</p> <pre><code>#setup parallel backend to use more than one processors\n\n# define number of cores (you can switch the value to a higher numer of your computer has more cores)\n# for checking how many cores your computer has you can run: detectCores()\nncors=2\ncl&lt;-makeCluster(ncors)\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\n\n# get timestamp to see how long the process takes\nprint(timestamp())\n</code></pre> <p>At this point the pure processing part begins. The processing is devided into four steps. First, the extent of the i-th grid cell is defined by taking the i-th row from the variable cases2 created above. Second, the raster image is clipped with the extent. Third, landscape metrics are caclulated for the clipped raster-subset. Fourth, all metrics are merged into a single variable cstat2 and center coordinates of the current grid cell are added to this variable (to allow for copying the information back to a raster later on). This variable is then returned and the next iteration is started:</p> <pre><code>rs &lt;- foreach(i=1:length(cases2[,1]), .packages=c(\"raster\", \"SDMTools\")) %dopar% {\n\n  # create an extent file using the coordinates from the coordinate list\n  e2 &lt;- extent(cases2[i,1], cases2[i,2], cases2[i,3], cases2[i,4])\n  # crop the large image to the tile\n  img &lt;- crop(inp, e2)\n\n  # calculate landscape metrics for the file\n  cstat &lt;- ClassStat(img, cellsize = 10)\n  cstat1 &lt;- PatchStat(img, cellsize = 10)\n\n  cstat2 &lt;- cbind(cstat, cstat1)\n\n  # transform results to dataframe\n  cstat2 &lt;- as.data.frame(cstat2)\n\n  # attach mean x and y coordinates to the results for comfortable plotting afterwards\n  x_mean &lt;- (cases2[i,1] + cases2[i,2])/2\n  y_mean &lt;- (cases2[i,3] + cases2[i,4])/2\n\n  cstat2$xm &lt;- rep(x_mean, length(cstat2[,1]))\n  cstat2$ym &lt;- rep(y_mean, length(cstat2[,1]))\n\n  #patch\n\n  #return final dataframe to store in list\n  cstat2\n\n}\n\n# stop parallel processing\nstopCluster(cl)\n\n#get another timestamp to see how long it tood\nprint(timestamp())\n</code></pre> <p>After landscape metrics have been calculated for all grid cells, the raw output data has to be further processed to transfer them back into raster files. The result of the for-loop described above are stored in a variable called \"rs\" which is in the list-format of R. As first step, we transfer this list into a dataframe by applying the rbind-function to all entries in the list:</p> <pre><code># check first results\nhead(rs)\n# bind all results to have one large dataframe\nrs_fin &lt;- do.call(rbind, rs)\n\n#check final results\nhead(rs_fin)\n</code></pre> <p>This results in:</p> <p></p> <p>Next, we extract one of the landscape metrics for one of the five examined land-cover classes and save it as a raster file. In theory all calculated metrics could be saved using the same procedure with some small adaptations to the code. In the code below we select the landcover class 1 which is forest. Details are provided in the comments to the code.</p> <pre><code>##################################################\n## start postprocessing results\n##################################################\n\n## extract number of patches for yth land-use class\n\ndev.off()\n\n# select land-cover class (1 = forest)\nluc_class=1\n\n# subset the overall results to only keep values of the selected land-cover class\nrs_fin_cl &lt;- rs_fin[rs_fin$class==luc_class,]\n\n# check the available metrics\ncolnames(rs_fin_cl)\n\n# select one metric - in this case metric 4 which is the percentage cover of the target class\n# in a given grid cell \nmetric = 4\n\n# prepare map of percentage cover of forest\n# to do this, first build a table including the center coordinates of each grid cell\n# and the selected metric\ninp_ras &lt;- cbind(rs_fin_cl$xm, rs_fin_cl$ym, rs_fin_cl[,metric])\n\n# then use the rasterfromXZY-function to create a raster file\ndfr &lt;- rasterFromXYZ(inp_ras)\n\n# copy the coordinate reference system information to transfer the raster to a\n# raster with geoinformation\ncrs(dfr) &lt;- crs(ls_luc)\n\n# plot the map\nplot(dfr, main=colnames(rs_fin_cl)[metric])\n\n# save result to tiff-file that can be opened in QGIS\nwriteRaster(dfr, \"prop_forest_area.tif\", format=\"GTiff\", overwrite=T)\n</code></pre> <p>We have now calculated a first landscape metric-map in R. We can check our results by loading the just created prop_forest_area.tif file into our QGIS project from the start of the tutorial. If we now compare the land-cover map with the percentage cover raster we calculated (depicted below after adapting the visualization settings), we can see that the results seem plausible. Grid cells covered only by forest have a 100% cover (value of 1) while areas with only smaller fractions of forest, show the corresponding values:</p> <p> </p> <p>You can see in the QGIS project that the current processing flow is not yet perfect, as we are losing a small part of the image edges (the created raster does not have exactly the same size as the input image). This is not fully solvable as long as the x- and y-ranges of the input image are not evenly dividable by the selected grid cell size. Related problems have been discussed in the theoretical part of today's course session. </p> <p>So you have now learned all the processing steps required to calculate landscape metrics from a land-cover map in R. For training and better understanding the code, I would recommend to adjust the code above a bit to calculate some more landscape metrics and also compare metrics amongst the different input-datasets with varying spatial resolution. In next week's practical exercise you will have to use the work-flow learned here, to solve a small ecological question.</p>"},{"location":"mintoring/mintoring/","title":"Mintoring","text":""},{"location":"mintoring/mintoring/#einfuhrung-in-arcmap","title":"Einf\u00fchrung in ArcMAP","text":"<p>Wir verwenden ArcMap.

We will learn more about this in one of the next lectures.</p> <p>Additionally, a band with ending</p> <p><code>..._ST_B10.TIF</code></p> <p>is available which represents the thermal band of Landsat with ST standing for \"surface temperature\".</p> <p>The exact physical units and scaling of the data contained in the images can be checked in the official product descriptions of the Landsat sensors. For the image I have downloaded, the corresponding information can be found in the report provided here.</p> <p>It is highly recommended to have a closer look at these reports and you will have to do this to answer some of the questions asked below.</p> <p>For now, we will focus on the spectral bands containing surface reflectance information (bands are marked in red in Figure 1. ). We will now use QGIS to stack these bands and save them into a single multi-layer/band geotiff file.</p> <p>To do this we open the Toolbox in QGIS (if not already open) by selecting:</p> <p><code>Processing (in the main file menu) \u21d2 Toolbox</code></p> <p>Then we search for the keyword \"merge\" in the toolbox window as shown in Figure 2.</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: Find the GDAL-merge tool <p>In the list of returned tools, we select the \"merge\" tool listed under GDAL \u21d2 Raster miscellaneous and double click-it to open it (tool is selected in Figure 02).</p> <p> </p> Figure 3: The GDAL-merge tool <p>In the upcoming dialogue shown in Figure 3, we will then have to add the 7 Landsat channels containing the spectral values observed by the satellite sensor. For this we press the \"...\" - button next to the \"input Layers\" section. </p> <p> </p> Figure 4: Adding bands to the merge tool <p>The menu will change to a new window as shown in Figure 4. Here, we will now press the \"Add File(s)\" button (marked with 1 in Figure 4) and select the 7 spectral bands with the endings <code>_SR_B*.TIF</code> as marked in Figure 1 and confirm with \"open\". Make sure that the order is also correct with B1 being the first/top band and B7 the last/bottom. If everything is correct, use the \"arrow button\" marked with 2 in Figure 4 to return to the main menu of the \"merge\" tool.</p> <p> </p> Figure 5: Applying  the merge tool <p>As last step we select the option \"Place each input file into a separate band\" and define an output filename and path (as marked with 1 and 2 in Figure 5). Then we click \"run\" to merge the 7 bands into a single multi-layer/band geotif-file.</p> <p> </p> Figure 6: The resulting merged multi-band image <p>This should result in a view similar as in Figure 6 - even though the actual view might of course be very different depending on which image you downloaded. With some adjustment of the visualization settings with which you should already be familiar with from the GIS-parts of the course we can obtain a RGB-view of the satellite images, mimicking the visual impression we have as humans (Figure 7).</p> <p> </p> Figure 7: The resulting merged multi-band image in RGB view <p>You should now be able to pre-process and visualize Landsat images in QGIS. This is a really interesting skill, considering that Landsat images are available since 1972 and for the complete globe. The number of bands to merge and the visualization settings will differ depending on the Landsat sensor with which the data was collected, but you will always be able to understand which bands you have to add to your image stack if you refer to the Landsat product guides which you can find under the links above.</p>"},{"location":"planetary-sciences/01-download-ls-and-s2/#pre-process-the-sentinel-2-image-into-a-multi-layer-geotiff-file-using-snap","title":"Pre-process the Sentinel-2 image into a multi-layer geotiff file using SNAP","text":"<p>After downloading the Sentinel-2 image and extracting the archive file on your hard-disc you should have a file folder similar to the one shown in Figure 8. </p> <p> </p> Figure 8: Files of a Sentinel-2 image after extraction <p>In case of Sentinel-2, the situation is even more complex than with Landsat and not only numerous files are visible but there are even several sub-folders containing meta-data as well as the original image files.

Besides the data format we have to consider as well that not all bands of Sentinel-2 have the same spatial resolution. There are four bands at 10 m spatial resolution (pixel size) and 6 bands at 20 m spatial resolution. Furthermore, there are two bands with 60 m spatial resolution. The latter are mostly used to inform atmospheric correction algorithms.</p> <p>The typical procedure to pre-process Sentinel-2 images hence includes to build a subset of only the bands with 10 and 20 m spatial resolution, stack them, resample some of the bands and save all bands into a multi-layer/band file with either 10 or 20 m pixel size.</p> <p>The probably easiest way to accomplish these pre-processing steps is to use the SNAP toolbox of the European Space Agency. SNAP is a quite complete free and open-access toolbox which offers numerous tools to visualize and analyse remote sensing data. In the following, we will not explore all options that are available in SNAP, but if you are interested in getting to know the software a bit better, there are numerous resources on the web, including the tutorials on the official webpage</p> <p>As well as some inofficial youtube-videos such as.</p> <p>Here, we will only get to know the steps necessary to load the S2-image into SNAP and save the image into a multi-layer/band geotif file.</p> <p>For this we first open SNAP.

In my case this looks like shown in Figure 14.</p> <p> </p> Figure 14: RGB view of the Sentinel-2 image <p>We will not dive further into the various visualization options SNAP offers but directly continue with the pre-processing steps.</p> <p>For this we select </p> <p><code>Raster  \u21d2 Subset</code></p> <p>as shown in Figure 15.</p> <p> </p> Figure 15: Subset Sentinel-2 image <p>From the main file menu. In the appearing dialogue, we select the \"band subset\" section as marked in Figure 16. Here, we now select only the Sentinel-2 bands that either have a spatial resolution of 10 or 20 m. Formulated in other words, we will drop the bands 1, 9 and 10 which all have a spatial resolution of 60 m. Please be aware that you have to know which Sentinel-2 bands have which spatial resolution. You can also check this in the meta-data but it is somehow expected that you familiarized yourself with the sensor of the data you are working with.</p> <p>Technical details of the Sentinel-2 sensors can be found for example here</p> <p> </p> Figure 16: Selecting only bands with 10 or 20 m spatial resolution <p>We then confirm with \"OK\" and a new version of my image will immediately appear in the Product Explorer window.

The actual processing and subsetting of the bands will only take place, once the image is saved to a new file. </p> <p>Before we can actually save the image to a geotif-file, we will have to conduct one additional pre-processing step.

In my case, I select a band with 10 m spatial resolution (Band 2).</p> <p> </p> Figure 18: The resampling tool in SNAP <p>The resampling method is set to \"Nearest\" to not induce any changes to the measured values.</p> <p>We confirm by pressing \"Run\".</p> <p>After pressing \"Run\", immediately a new image product will appear in the Product Explorer window.

Now the actual processing of the image starts. Hence, this whole procedure may take a while since all of the steps defined above, that is, subsetting the image, reampling the image and saving the image to a Tiff-file will now all be performed one after the other.</p> <p> </p> Figure 21: Export the Sentinel-2 image to a geotif file <p>If you want to make sure that everything has worked fine, you can load the exported Geotif-file in QGIS and visualize it as a RGB image as you have learned in during earlier lectures of the course. </p>"},{"location":"planetary-sciences/01-download-ls-and-s2/#exercises","title":"Exercises","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Identify the physical unit and scaling of the Landsat and Sentinel-2 image you have downloaded.

QGIS will automatically select a visualization setting of the raster dataset based on the statistics of a few randomly selected pixels. However, in most cases these settings will not be optimal. So do not worry if the displayed raster seems to be very dark or with strange colors when using other datasets. In some cases it might even look completely black but still contain relevant data which will only show up after the visualization has been optimized. In our case the first impression should already be quite good, eventhough, it is not yet a realistic true-colour visualization (which describes a visual impression similar to what we see with our eyes). In the next section we will learn how the achieve this.</p>"},{"location":"qgis/03-raster-data/#rgb-visualization-of-raster-files","title":"RGB-Visualization of raster files","text":"<p>To better understand how the optimization of the visualization of raster files works, it is important to have a good understanding how raster files are structured. Raster files can be pictured as a grid of pixels where each pixel contains a value. The range of these values depends on the data source for the raster data. They could for example originate from a model simulation that predicted air temperature. Then each pixel might have a value between approximately -30 and +50 showing the air temperature above the Earth surface in Degree Celsius. The values might also contain information about the altitude above (and below) sea level and might then range from -413 m (deepest point below sea level on a land surface, an area close to the Dead sea) to 8848 m (top of the Mount Everest).  In our case, the raster dataset stems from a satellite sensor which measures the amount of electromagnetic radiation reflected in certain wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. In simpler words, one could say that the satellite sensor measures the amount of different colours (careful - this is a very simple way of putting it and physically not really correct) at certain locations (pixels) on the Earth surface and then stores this information into individual raster layers (see Figure 5). In our case, the satellite raster dataset consists of 10 raster layers that store information on how much blue, green and red light (and some additional colours that humans cannot see with their eyes) have been reflected in the different areas of the Earth surface that were observed by the satellite. Each raster layer contains information on one colour. Hence, our raster dataset can be pictured as a stack of individual raster layers or images which will be called bands or channels in the following (Figure 6 )1.</p> <p> </p> Figure 5: Structure of raster data <p> </p> Figure 6: Raster stack <p>In QGIS we can always only use either just one band - Render type: Single band gray (render type can be selected in drop-down menu marked with 1 in Figure 8) or a set of three bands - Render type: Multiband color (also known as RGB-composite) - to create a visualization of the raster dataset. This is related to the way computers create colours on the screen. Basically, there are only three colours: red, green and blue which are then mixed on a very fine scale to create a visual impression of all colours that we see on the screen. During the visualization optimization we tell QGIS which three bands of the raster dataset should be used to create red, green and blue colours on the screen. </p> <p>So let us try this with our satellite image. To change the visualization settings of the loaded raster data,</p> <p>we either perform a right click on the raster layer in the layer window of QGIS and select properties or alternatively, we can perform a double-click on the same layer. This will open up the properties window, where we will select the Symbology tab. (marked with the red box in Figure 7)2</p> <p> </p> Figure 7: Raster symbology window of QGIS <p>Now we will assign the satellite bands which collected information on blue, green and red colours to the corresponding channels of QGIS. The red channel of QGIS (marked with 2 in Figure 7) is currently assigned to Channel 1. We will now change this by</p> <p>Clicking the drop down menu for the Red Band (marked with 2 in Figure 7) and select Band 03, which corresponds to the band of the satellite that collected information on electromagnetic radiation that corresponds to red light. Analogously, we will select Band 02 for the Green Band of QGIS (marked with 3 in Figure 7 normally, this channel should already be correct) and then Band 01 for the Blue band of QGIS (marked with 4 in Figure 7). Then we select Apply and then OK to see how this changes the visualization of the image (Figure 8).</p> <p> </p> Figure 8: View after adjusting the settings <p>In the new visualization (as seen in Figure 8) we can see that the colours on the land surface of the satellite image look more natural to us now. However, we can also see that the sea surface seems to be very dark and not blue as we might have expected. This relates to the fact that water has very low reflectance values across all wavelengths (colours) and typically appears very dark in satellite images as it absorbs most of the incoming radiation/energy/light. This raises the question whether we can increase the information content for these areas by adjusting the settings some more. Let's try!</p> <p>To do this,</p> <p>We return to the Properties window and select the Symbology tab. Now we will click the area marked with 6 in Figure 7 to open some additional options to load minimum and maximum values for each raster layer as depicted in Figure 9.</p> <p> </p> Figure 9: Raster symbology window in QGIS - advanced settings <p>There are three options available to automatically derive minimum and maximum pixel values between which the available range of colours intensities will be spanned. These minimum and maximum values are marked with 1 in Figure 9. To estimate the minimum and maximum values, QGIS uses a set of random pixel values that it collects in the image. Then it applies some statistics on the pixel values to understand how the pixel values are distributed in the value range. The three options to calculate the statistics are cumulative count cut, min / max and mean \u00b1 standard deviation (box marked with 2 in Figure 9).</p> <p>So why do we have to use such statistics to improve the visualization? This can be explained best using a histogram. A histogram shows the distribution of values of a dataset by plotting the frequency of values occurring in a defined value range on the y-axis and the value ranges themselves on the x axis. In Figure 10 an example for a histogram of the pixel values of a raster image is shown. In the upper part of Figure 10 one can see the histogram of the full value range of the raster image with values between 0 and 255 (which would indicate an eight bit image). In this histogram one can clearly see that there are hardly any very low values (close to 0) and also hardly any very high values (close to 255), while most values accumulate in the middle of the value range (between around 60 and 180).</p> <p> </p> Figure 10: A histogram of raster values <p>So how would QGIS now translate these values into colours? Assuming QGIS is attempting to visualize a single raster layer with pixel values as indicated in Figure 10 it would conduct the following steps: Pixels having a value of 0 will be set to the colour black and pixels having the maximum value of 255 will be set to the colour white. All pixels with values inbetween will receive a grey value that is darker if the value is low (closer to black) and brighter if the value is high (closer to white).</p> <p>If such a translation between the minimum and maximum value is conducted based on the full value range, most pixels of the image will be displayed in intermediate grey levels, while there will be hardly any white or black pixels (as there are hardly any pixels having values close to 0 or to 255). That means the visualization will loose a lot of so called contrast in the image. To avoid this, it is possible to adapt the value range displayed on the screen in QGIS. With this step, the extreme values to which black and white colours are assigned will be newly assigned. In the bottom of Figure 10 this is done by setting the minimum value (corresponds to black) to 60 and the maximum value (corresponds to white) to 180. Now the histogram is stretched and we would see the full range of colours between black and white in the image with a maximized contrast.</p> <p>The same procedure is applied in QGIS when changing the Min and Max values of the three bands (section marked with 1 in Figure 9). As said before, this can be done automatically by using the three options to calculate statistics based on some pixel values or it can also be accomplished by editing the min and max values manually. You could for example change the Min values of all bands to a higher values and see how this affects the visualization of the image. In the next step, we will learn a standard-procedure to adapt these settings.</p> <p>We will now adapt the value ranges of the three channels of our satellite image using the standard statistical approach. We do this by</p> <p>selecting the option mean +- standard deviation and keeping the default settings. We confirm by pressing Apply and OK.</p> <p>This will result in the image shown in (Figure 11)3</p> <p> </p> Figure 11: View after adjusting the image stretch <p>The colour of the sea has turned from very dark or black to blue which may match better what we would expect to see. However, one can also see that the land surface areas seems to be quite bright now compared to the sea. So adjusting visualization options is often a compromise and it might not be possible to show all areas/surface types in their optimal settings at the same time.</p> <p>In the new visualization settings, the sea appears blue but also shows some more details in compared to the earlier two visualization settings. However, might there be ways to further  adapt the visualization to see even more details of the sea? </p> <p> </p> Figure 12: The zoom tool of QGIS <p>Indeed there are! One solution is to adapt the value range again but this time only considering pixels from the sea. In QGIS, there is one option to do this which we will explore as next step. First, we use the zoom-tool of QGIS (marked in Figure 12) to zoom into an area where only sea is visible by</p> <p>clicking the zoom tool-button and then dragging a square within an area of the image which is only covered by the sea. This will lead to a view where only blue areas are visible in the QGIS visualization window (as shown in Figure 14). Next, we will repeat the steps to optimize the value ranges as we have learned before. That is, we will open the properties window, select the symbology tab and open the option to automatically estimate minimum and maximum values by clicking the area marked with 6 in Figure 7. The only thing we will do difffferent this time, is that we will change the dropdown menu marked with 3 in Figure 9 from Whole Raster to Current canvas. Then we will press Apply and then OK and close the Properties window.</p> <p> </p> Figure 13: View after applying the zoom tool to zoom into an area only covered by the sea <p> </p> Figure 14: View after optimizing the visualization settings for the sea <p>The will lead to a new visualization as shown in Figure 14. As you can see, the formerly uniformely blue image turned into a quite colorful image where lots of fine details about the sea surface became visible. By activating the Current canvas option, QGIS calculated the statistics only for pixels located in the currently visible part of the image. That is, only sea pixels were considered to derive the min and max values. If you now use the zoom-out button, located next to the zoom-in button, you can see that all the other areas in the image are very bright and no details can be seen anymore in these areas (Figure 15). This is because all of the land-surface areas have notably higher pixel values than the pixels located in the sea and are hence mostly assigned the maximum value of the defined range. You can also re-open the properties window and the style tab and have a look at the current value.</p> <p> </p> Figure 15: View of the full image after the adaptation of the visualization options to improve the level of details displayed in sea areas"},{"location":"qgis/03-raster-data/#exercise","title":"Exercise","text":"<p>To practice a bit more raster visualization options, try do conduct the following exercises:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Change the multi-band visualization by assigning other bands of the satellite image to the red, green and blue channel of QGIS.

A further alternative to using the \u201czoom-in\u201d button is to simply use the mouse\u2013wheel. If you navigate the mouse cursor over the main visualization window and rotate the mouse-wheel you will directly see the zoom\u2013effect.</p> <p>In case you want to zoom-out again, you have several options to do this.

There are three options: 1. Point 2. Line and 3. Polygon \u2013 see also area marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 2. Furthermore, it is necessary to define a coordinate reference system (CRS) - marked with \u201c2\u201d in Figure 2. We will now do this by</p> <p>selecting \u201cPolygon\u201d and then defining the CRS by clicking the little \u201cglobe\u201d button marked with the red frame in Figure 2</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: Selecting the correct settings for a Shapefile. <p>However, we first have to decide what is the correct coordinate reference system. As you can see form Figure 3 there are very many coordinate reference systems (CRS) to choose from. In our case, we will simply select the coordinate reference system of the already loaded satellite image. This is often an easy solution if no further information about coordinate reference systems is available.  In our case, we can find out the coordinate reference system of the satellite image by having a look at the lower right corner of the QGIS graphical user interface as marked in Figure 4. At this position you will always see the current CRS of the QGIS project. It is normally defined by the first datasets that gets loaded into a project. In our case, the satellite image was loaded first, so the whole project was adapted to the CRS of the satellite image. In case several datasets are loaded, they might have differing CRS. We will investigate such a case in one of the Tutorials which are still to come.</p> <p> </p> Figure 3: Defining the coordinate reference system. <p> </p> Figure 4: Identify the coordinate reference system of the current QGIS project. <p>So how do we ensure that the CRS of our new Shapefile matches the CRS of the satellite image? In Figure 4 we can see that the CRS of the current QGIS project and hence the satellite image has the EPSG code: 32633. We will now select the same CRS in the \u201cselect CRS dialogue\u201d in QGIS by</p> <p>clicking in the \u201cFilter\u201d area marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 3, then we enter the digits of the EPSG code, that is \u201c32633\u201d. By doing this, all CRS systems except for a single one will disappear (see Figure 5). As you will learn in the theoretical lectures, each EPSG code is unique! So we will now select the coordinate system \u201cWGS 84 / UTM zone 33N\u201d and confirm with clicking \u201cOK\u201d. As final step, we will have to define a name for the shapefile and the folder where you want to store it. To do this, we click the ... button in the top right of the form next to the \"File name\" field and enter a filename and navigate to the folder where we want to store the new Shapefile. Name the Shapefile \u201cPolygon_tut5.shp\u201d, press \u201cOK\" and \"OK\" again in the main form to create the new Polygon Shapefile.</p> <p> </p> Figure 5: Filtering using the EPSG code. <p>This should lead to a new situation as depicted in Figure 6. As you can see, not too much has changed as the Polygon-Shapefile currently is still empty and contains no spatial features. We will learn how we can add new features in the next section.</p> <p> </p> Figure 6: Situation after creating a shapefile."},{"location":"qgis/05-digitizing/#digitalization-of-new-spatial-objects-into-a-shapefile-layer","title":"Digitalization of new spatial objects into a Shapefile layer","text":"<p>In this section we will mostly work with the \u201cDigitizing toolbar\u201d which can be seen in Figure 7. In your case the buttons of the editing toolbar will most likely be still greyed out and only the button marked with \u201c2\u201d might be a active depending on which layer is currently selected in the layer window section of QGIS. So to activate the other buttons, we have to initialize the digitalization process. To do this, we</p> <p>we first select the newly created \u201cPolygon_tut5\u201d layer in the layer window. Then we initialize the digitalization process of this Shapefile by clicking the button marked with \u201c2\u201d in Figure 7. The Shapefile is now in the \u201cEditing mode\u201d and new spatial features can be added and old spatial features can be changed or deleted.</p> <p> </p> Figure 7: Filtering using the EPSG code. <p>As next step we will digitize the crater area of the vulcano and calculate its area. To accomplish this, we</p> <p>first zoom in to the vulcano area by using the zoom-in tool which we already know from the earlier tutorials. Then select the button marked with \u201c4\u201d in Figure 7. This button allows us to create a new spatial object - in this case a Polygon as we are editing a polygon shapefile. The symbol would differ in case we would edit a point or a line\u2013shapefile. After selecting the button, start digitizing the circumference of the vulcano crater by navigating the mouse cursor over the edges of the crater and performing a left\u2013click, then move the mourse cursor a bit further and perform another left\u2013click and so on until you have surrounded the whole crater (see Figure 8). When you are happy with your polygon, perform a right\u2013click to finish the polygon. QGIS will ask you to enter an id - you can either enter a number or just click \u201cOK\u201d. For the moment this option is not yet relevant.</p> <p> </p> Figure 8: Polygon surrounded the whole crater. <p>After finishing the polygon, the transparent colour of the \u201cpolygon-in-progress\u201d will change to a solid colour (see Figure 9). In case you do not like this format of the Polygons, you can switch the colour, or add transparency using the \u201cSymbology\u201d tab in the \u201cProperties\u201d window as you have learned in the earlier Tutorials. Be aware that you can also adapt the transparency of only the fill-colour while keeping the colour of the Outline solid (try to find out how this works!). If you are happy with your newly ceated Polygon click the button marked with \u201c3\u201d in Figure 7 to save the edits you made. If you do not want to add any further objects click button marked with \u201c2\u201d again to stop the editing mode.</p> <p> </p> Figure 9: Creating a new Polygon over the crater area of the vulcan. <p>In case you think that your Polygon is not accurate enough and you would like to correct some of the points between which the Polygon is spanned (this points are called \u201cnodes\u201d), QGIS offers a tool to adapt the shape of Polygons. This function is available when pressing the button marked with \u201c7\u201d in Figure 7. So let\u2019s try this out.</p> <p>First activate the editing mode as already learnt, then select the \u201cNode\u201d Tool (button 7) and then click on the Polygon you want to edit. In our case we only have a single Polygon. Once the Polygon has been selected, all nodes appear as rectangles and can now be rearranged / moved by putting the mouse cursor over them clicking and holding the left mouse\u2013button and draging them to the desired position - see Figure 10</p> <p> </p> Figure 10: Editing Nodes of a Polygon. <p>Now you are able to create new spatial objects and adapt the shape of an existing object. Next, we will have a quick look on the other buttons illustrated in Figure 7. First we will try to create a Polygon element of a circle. To do this, we</p> <p>click the button marked with \u201c5\u201d. Then we click somewhere in main visualization window of QGIS to set the starting point, a second time to set the ending point and a third time to set the point of maximum distance from the \u201cbaseline\u201d. Then QGIS will create an element of a circle as illustrated in Figure 11</p> <p> </p> Figure 11: The newly created element of a circle Polygon. <p>In our case this new polygon does not make too much sense. So we would like to delete it again. In order to this,</p> <p>we first select the \u201cSelect Feature\u201d button as highlighted in Figure 11 and then click on the newly created element of a circle Polygon. By clicking on it, it will be selected and turn its colour to yellow - see Figure 12 . To delete the element, we can either click on the button marked with \u201c8\u201d in Figure 7 or simply press the \u201cdel\u201d or \u201centf\u201d key on the keyboard.</p> <p> </p> Figure 12: Selecting the newly created element of a circle Polygon. <p>Now the polygon should disappear again. The remaining buttons are typically used less frequently, but are still very useful in some occasions. In brief, the button marked with \u201c6\u201d in Figure 7 allows to move complete spatial objects around after they have been selected with the \u201cSelect Feature\u201d tool. The buttons marked with \u201c9\u201d, \u201c10\u201d and \u201c11\u201d offer the possibilities to \u201ccut out\u201d, \u201ccopy\u201d and \u201cpaste\u201d polygons. To find out how this works,</p> <p>play around a bit with the buttons and try to create a situation which looks similar to Figure 13</p> <p> </p> Figure 13: Situation after copy and pasting the original polygon two times and shifting the pasted Polygons to new locations."},{"location":"qgis/05-digitizing/#buffer-analysis","title":"Buffer analysis","text":"<p>In this section, we will for the first time use a tool of QGIS that is not included in the standard processing tools and can only be found using the processing toolbox. Normally, the processing toolbox is already opened when opening QGIS (see box marked on the right part of Figure 14). In case it is not visible, it can be opened by selecting \u201cProcessing\u201d and then \u201cToolbox\u201d from the main menu of QGIS as also shown in Figure 14.</p> <p> </p> Figure 14: The processing toolbox. <p>Finding the correct tool that is able to conduct the action we want to perform on our data is not always easy. The best option is to directly know the name of the tool. This is similar to learning vocabulary in a foreign language. In case you know the name of the tool that you want to use, you can simply type in its name in the field marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 15. Alternatively, you can browse through the available tools by opening the menus in the \u201cProcessing Toolbox window\u201d. Typically, the tools are sorted according to their input data type, that is there are separate tools for raster datasets and vector datasets.</p> <p> </p> Figure 15: The processing toolbox. <p>You can find further tools including the most commonly applied ones in the main menu of QGIS where you can find the two menu sections called \u201cVector\u201d and \u201c Raster\u201d which contain plenty of options to process each datatype. It is highly recommended to also try out some of these tools and find out yourself what they are doing. In most cases there is also some further information given once the tool is started.</p> <p>The best way to learn to handle a GIS is to first learn the basics (for example using these Tutorials) but then also try out a lot on your own! Don\u2019t be shy!</p> <p>But back to our polygon. The first analysis tool we want to apply to our newly created Polygon is the \u201cbuffer-tool\u201d. It will create a zone of equidistance around an existing spatial feature. This will become fully clear once you see the results. So in order to create a buffer-Polygon around our existing Polygon, we</p> <p>write the word \u201cbuffer\u201d in the area marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 15. From the multiple options appearing we select the tool \u201cBuffer vectors\u201d from the \u201cGDAL/OGR toolbox\u201d and the \u201c[OGR] Geoprocessing\u201d menu (marked with \u201c2\u201d in Figure 15). By double clicking the tool, we can open a new window which allows us to specify the settings for the new buffer polygon we will create. In this window, we primarily have to define the buffer distance - in this case we set the distance to 500 - and we have to specify an output file. The corresponding fields are marked in Figure 16 with \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d. Then we click \u201crun\u201d and a new Shapefile containing the newly created buffer Polygon will be created and added to the QGIS project.</p> <p> </p> Figure 16: The processing toolbox. <p>After re-arranging the layers in the layer window section of QGIS, the new situation should look as shown in Figure 17. You can see that the new Polygon surrounds the old Polygon with a fixed distance of 500 m. It is important to consider that the buffer distance we defined in the preceding step is always in map units. In our case we used a UTM coordinate reference systems which is a metric system. So the defined buffer distance will be in meters. In case we would apply a buffer on a dataset projected in latitutde and longitude, the buffer distance would be in degree! So in case you experience that even with a small buffer distance the resulting buffer shapefiles become really large, it is likely that this relates to a problem of the buffer distance unit.</p> <p> </p> Figure 17: The processing toolbox."},{"location":"qgis/05-digitizing/#calculating-the-area-of-polygons-using-the-field-calculator-tool","title":"Calculating the area of Polygons using the Field Calculator tool","text":"<p>In this section, we will learn how to calculate the area of spatial polygon objects stored in a Shapefile. The same procedure can also be used to calculate lengths of Polylines and the x,y-coordinates of Points stored in Shapefiles. In our case we will calculate the area of the crater Polygon we have created earlier. To do this, we perform a right\u2013click on the \u201cPolygon_tut5\u201d layer in the layer window of QGIS and select the \u201cOpen Attribute Table\u201d option (see Figure 18).</p> <p> </p> Figure 18: Opening the attribute table. <p>This will open the new window displayed in Figure 19.

This new window represents the \u201cField calculator\u201d tool which is a powerful tool to update the attribute table of any vector layer and add new information to it. We will now use it to add a new columns to the attribute table of the Shapefile that contains the crater Polygon. As we can see in Figure 19, this Polygon currently contains only a single Polygon. We will later see other attribute tables with a lot more objects.</p> <p>To now add the area of our crater Polygon, we</p> <p>select \u201cCreate a new field\u201d, then we define an \u201cOutput field name\u201d by typing in \u201carea\u201d in the field marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 20. Next, we have to define the \u201cOutput field type\u201d. Here we click on the drop\u2013down\u2013menu marked with \u201c2\u201d and select \u201cDecimal number (real)\u201d.

This is similar to defining the cell format in Excel. In our case we want the area to be a decimal number which means that we can also have digitis behind the comma. As you remember from the thoretical lecture, the option \u201cWhole number (integer)\u201d can only store whole numbers like 1, 2, 3, 34, 789 etc., while a \u201cDecimal number (real)\u201d field is able to store decimal numbers such as 45.3 or 648.99932. The number of digits behind the comma are defined with the \u201cPrecision field\u201d while Output field lengths defines the number of total digits (digits before and after the comma together). So in our case,</p> <p>we will set the \u201cOutput field lengths\u201d to 15 and the \u201cPrecision\u201d to 2.</p> <p>A short summary what the other \u201cOutput field types\u201d mean is given in Table 1.</p> <p>Table 1: Output field types | Field type | Brief description | |--|--| | Whole number (integer) | This field type can store whole numbers (numbers without commas) between 2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.

It can stores numbers between 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | | Decimal number (real) | This is the field type that can store any numbers with decimals. | | Text (string) | This field type will store everything as text. Applying mathmatical functions will not work with this field type - even if only numbers are stored in the column. | | Date | This field type will only store Dates.</p> <p> </p> Figure 20: Opening the attribute table. <p>We have now defined how the output column of the attribute table that will store the \u201carea value\u201d of our Polygon should look like. Now we have to tell QGIS that it should calculate the area of the Polygon. To do this,</p> <p>we open the menu marked with \u201c4\u201d in Figure 20 and then double-click the option \u201c$area\u201d which will then also appear in the \u201cExpression\u201d section on the left, which has been empty so far.</p> <p>After conducting all these steps, the \u201cField Calculator\u201d window should look like shown in Figure 21. If this is the case, click \u201cOK\u201d and the window will disappear.</p> <p>If we now have another look at the attribute table of the \u201cPolygon_tut5\u201d Layer, we will see that a new column has been added to the attribute table that contains the area of the Polygon (see Figure 22). In our case the value is given in square meters as the defined UTM coordinate system is a metric system. For the Polygon created in this Tutorial the area is 249400.03 square meters. This value is likely to differ in your case, eventhough it should be similar.</p> <p> </p> Figure 21: Opening the attribute table. <p> </p> Figure 22: Opening the attribute table. <p>As a last step for this section, we will transform the area value given in square\u2013meters to square kilometers. Do this we will again use the field calculator tool:</p> <p>Open the attribute table of \u201cPolygon_tut5\u201d Layer, then click the \u201cField calculator\u201d button. Define a new field called \u201carea_km\u201d, select \u201cDecimal number (real)\u201d as \u201cOutput field type\u201d and set the \u201cOutput field length\u201c to 15 and \u201cPrecision\u201d to 5.</p> <p> </p> Figure 23: Field calculator. <p>All these steps should already be familiar. However, now a new aspect comes into to play. While we used the tool or command \u201c$area\u201d in the first application of the \u201cField calculator\u201d to calculate the area, we will this time use the just calculated \u201carea\u201d field as input to the \u201cExpression\u201d section, where we will define the function to transform the values given in square meters to values in square kilometers. To achieve this:</p> <p>we first open the menu called \u201cFields and Values\u201d as marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 23. Then we double\u2013click the entry \u201carea\u201d which is the column in the attibute table that we have just created. The \u201carea\u201d variable will now appear in the \u201cExpression\u201d editor to the left. We will now add the formula to transform square meters to square kilometers by first clicking the \u201cDivision operator\u201d marked with \u201c2\u201d in Figure 23 and then entering \u201c1000000\u201d as 1000000 square meter equal 1 square km. We then press \u201cOK\u201d.</p> <p>This will add another column to the attribute table that contains the area of the Polygon in square kilometers as seen in Figure 24.</p> <p> </p> Figure 24: Another column has been added to the attribute table."},{"location":"qgis/05-digitizing/#exercise","title":"Exercise","text":"<p>In Figure 23 you can see two red circles.

The newly loaded Shapefile contains information on the position and type of the transportation network of the area. We now assume that our vulcano is in the mood for some chaos and erupts.

To be able to plan restoration measures and support emergency activities, we want to automatically select all roads in a distance of 5000 m from the crater center.</p> <p> </p> Figure 2: Loaded road network layer.    <p>We will accomplish this, using a spatial selection which is also called a \u201cspatial query\u201d. In QGIS this requires two steps. First, we need to create a buffer around the crater center point, which we have created as first step of this Tutorial. Then we can automatically identify all spatial features of the \u201c\u201cgis.osm_roads_subset\u201d layer that intersect with the buffer polygon.</p> <p>So as first step,</p> <p>use the buffer tool, you already know, to create a buffer with a distance of 5000 m around the point located in the center of the crater.

We have to define the vector file from which we want to select some spatial features \u2013 in this case the road network layer \u2013 and we have to define the vector file which contains the spatial features which are used to define the area for selecting the spatial features - in our case the 5000 m buffer layer. We also have to define how the two vector files should interact to decide which features get selected. In this case we select \u201cintersect\u201d \u2013 this will select all spatial features of the road network layer that intersect with the buffer polygon. Finally, we select \u201cCreating new Selection\u201d to cancel all eventually earlier performed selections within the road network layer.

In this Tutorial we will make use of a elevation dataset provided by United States Geological Survey (USGS). This dataset stems from a satellite mission called ASTER. The data of ASTER was transformed to an almost global elevation dataset by analysing a huge amount of satellite images that were collected from differing view angles (typically more than 10 and in some cases over 30 satellite images for each location of the Earth). Elevation datasets can also be collected from other sources including field data (for example using traditional survey techniques which is rather time-intensive or GPS which is faster but also less precise as the z-position generally works not as accurate as x- and y-position using standard GPS devices) and remote sensing data as for example airborne laserscanning or since recently also airborne photogrammetry using aerial images. The currently most accurate, spatially continuous elevation datasets can be collected with laserscanning devices mounted on airplanes or helicopters (we will hear about this in the theoretic lectures after the  christmas break).</p> <p>However, as stated before, in this tutorial we will use the freely available ASTER datasets with a pixel size of approximately 30 m.</p> <p>As a first step</p> <p>we again load the raster dataset \u201cS2_Neapel_sm2.tif\u201d located in the \u201cDatasets/S2\u201d folder and adapt the visualization settings to have a balanced view of all classes by using the channels R=3, G=2, B=1 and loading new max / min values using the \u201cSymbology\u201d-tab in the properties window. Then we add the ASTER dataset which is called \u201cASTGTM2_N40E014_dem.tif\u201d and which can be downloaded here:</p> <p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TjHeuPUX_SLzBFrQqblocHJOUJg45UTG/view?usp=share_link</p> <p>This will lead to the situation shown in Figure 1. There are now two problems that we need to address. The first problem is not directly apparent, but currently the ASTER dataset and the satellite image have differing coordinate systems. This could lead to some problems when both images are used jointly in a geoprocessing tool. Hence, as a first step, we will reproject the ASTER dataset to the same coordinate reference system as the satellite image.</p> <p> </p> Figure 1: After loading the two raster datasets.    <p>Furthermore, as you can see in Figure 1 the elevation dataset covers an area that is larger than the satellite image and hence overlaps it completely. We will address this problem in a second step by clipping the ASTER dataset. But let us start with the reprojection.</p> <p>To re\u2013check whether the ASTER dataset really has a different coordinate reference system (CRS) than the satellite image we can</p> <p>perform a right\u2013click on the \u201cASTGTM2_N40E014_dem\u201d layer and select \u201cProperties\u201d.

After defining the correct Target CRS we press \u201cOK\u201d and QGIS will re-project the raster and add it as a new layer. If you now check the CRS of the new layer by performing a right\u2013click, selecting \u201cProperties\u201d and the \u201cGeneral\u201d tab, you will see that the CRS is now also set to 32633.</p> <p> </p> Figure 4: Parameterizing the \u201cWarp\u201d tool. <p>As next step, we will clip the re-projected elevation dataset to match roughly the extent of the satellite image.

We will now complete the expression by first clicking the \u201cgreater than\u201d button marked with \u201c4\u201d and then entering the digits \u201c50\u201d into the expression window. With this expression, all pixels in the re\u2013projected and clipped elevation raster with values above 50 m will be set to 1 and all pixels with values below 50 m will be set to 0. To check whether this works, we press the \u201cOK\u201d button.</p> <p> </p> Figure 19: Defining a threshold rule in the \u201craster calculator\u201d. <p>This will lead to the situation shown in Figure 20 where we can see that a binary raster image has been created where all pixels in the rasterfile have either a value of 0 or 1. We can clearly see, that especially the areas around the vulcano and the areas in the South and East \u2013 from which we know that they are rather mountainous \u2013 were found to have elevations above 50 m as indicated by the white colour which stands for a value of 1.</p> <p>Be aware that it could also happen that you see a completely grey output image.

In the elevation dataset, all areas covered by sea have a fixed elevation value of 0. So in the next step, we will apply another threshold but this time we want to extract all areas that are located higher than 0 m and lower than 50 m. To do this,</p> <p>re\u2013open the raster calculator tool as learned above. This time we set the threshold expression as indicated in Figure 21. We then press \u201cOK\u201d.</p> <p>This will lead to a new situation as shown in 22. We can now see that especially the central part of the image and some parts along the coast fulfill the criteria of having an elevation between 0 and 50 m. We now might be interested to overlay this information with our satellite image. Currently, the raster layer is just black and white and we can only activate and deactivate the layer to see which areas in the satellite scene are located between 0 and 50 m.

This map item can now be seen as a \u201cplaceholder\u201d that will always show the current visualization of the QGIS project if the view is updated. It will not update itself automatically. In Figure 13 you can see that the actual map content is not fully filling out the frame of the map\u2013item we have just created. We can address this problem by on the one hand side moving the map contents within the map\u2013item frame by using the tool marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 10 and on the other hand by adapting the current scale of the map. This can be achieved by first selecting the map\u2013item in the main visualization window and then selecting the \u201citem properties\u201d tab as marked with \u201c2\u201d in Figure 10.

We open the section and first of all press the green + button (marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 12) to add a grid. We can then adapt the properties of the grid by clicking the \"Modify Grid\" button (marked with \"2\" in Figure 12). In the situation shown in Figure 13 we selected \u201cFrame and annotations only\u201c as \u201cGrid type\u201d. This is a rather discreet solution as the grid is only depicted outside of the map. You can play around some more with the differing grid types and see which one you prefer. Furthermore, it is important to select the interval at which grid cells or annotations are set. In the given example the x and y intervals were set to 1000 map units, with map units being meter (area marked with \u201c3\u201d in Figure 13). Please be aware that the map units are only meters if the CRS of the project is set to EPSG 32633 (the crs of the Sentinel-2 image). If the project CRS is currently set to EPSG 4326, you might not see a grid at all since then 1000 as interval would mean 1000\u00b0 and hence there would no coordinate marked at all since the geographic coordinates only range from 0 to 180 degrees. If this would be the case for you, you can adapt the CRS in the map view by clicking the button marked with \"5\" in Figure 13. The frame style can be adapted using the area marked with \u201c4\u201d.</p> <p> </p> Figure 12: Adding a grid and drawing coordinates around the map. <p> </p> Figure 13: Adding a grid and drawing coordinates around the map. <p>To get a feeling for the multitude of available settings, it is best to play around with the different grid types and frame styles and just have a look how the displayed map changes.

Then you will find the option to activate the \u201cDraw coordinates\u201d check\u2013box as marked with \u201c1\u201d in Figure 16. In the same section you will find options to activate and de\u2013activate the coordinates for certain sides of the map (area marked with \u201c2\u201d in Figure 16). Generally, it is sufficient to draw the coordinates for one x and one y axis. Further down, it is possible to define the precision of the coordinate. While it makes sense to give precision with decimals for example when using a geographic coordinate system with latitude and longitude values, it in most cases does not make sense in metric coordinate systems such as UTM as most maps will typically not be resolved in sub-meter resolutions. In the example, the value was therefore set to 0.</p> <p> </p> Figure 14: Parameterizing the displayed coordinates <p>Next, we will add a North arrow and a scale bar to our map.

To tell QGIS where the points are located, we have to define a x-field containing the x-coordinates (Longitude) and the y-field containing the y-coordinates (Latitude). Finally we set the coordinate reference system to EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 (see area marked with \"5\") and click Add.

We will use the extent of the satellite image as area for the interpolation. Interpolation results can vary significantly based on the method and parameters you choose. QGIS in its standard installation provides two interpolation methods: Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). For the first part of the tutorial we are using the IDW method.</p> <p>First from the Processing Toolbox search and locate the \"Interpolation\" -&gt; \"IDW interpolation\" tool as shown in Figure 7.

Next we set the \"Distance coefficent P\" marked with \"3\". </p> <p>P is a important coefficcent in this method, because weights are proportional to the inverse of the distance (between the data point and the prediction location) raised to the power value P. So as mentioned above the result is dependent on this parameter.  As a result, as the distance increases, the weights decrease rapidly. The rate at which the weights decrease is dependent on the value of P. If P = 0, there is no decrease with distance, and because each weight is the same, the prediction will be the mean of all the data values in the search neighborhood. As P increases, the weights for distant points decrease rapidly. If the P value is very high, only the immediate surrounding points will influence the prediction.</p> <p>After setting P (you may try some different values for that) we set the extent (marked with \"4\" in Figure 8). For this we calculate the extent from our satellite image. Next you can set the Pixel size marked with \"5\". Note that the pixel size will affect the calculation time.

We can accomplish this by running:</p> <pre><code>library(hsdar)\n</code></pre> <p>If the package <code>hsdar</code> is not yet installed on your system, run the following command:</p> <pre><code>install.packages(\"hsdar\")\n</code></pre> <p>We can then have a closer look at the help page of the main function of the hsdar package which is called \u201cPROSAIL\u201d.</p> <pre><code>?PROSAIL\n</code></pre> <p>If you read through the function-call you will see that it is actually quite straightforward to simulate a spectrum using the PROSAIL function. You basically only have to define values for all of the plant traits and additionally for the sun-sensor geometry and run the function. In case you do not specify all traits, default values will be used for the remaining undefined traits.</p> <p>Now we are already ready to run a first PROSAIL simulation. For this, we have to define the vegetation traits within the PROSAIL function:</p> <pre><code># simulate simple vegetation spectrum\nveg_spectrum = spectra(PROSAIL(LAI=7, Cab = 40, Car=10, Cw = 0.1, Cm = 0.005, N=2, TypeLidf = 2, lidfa = 55))\n</code></pre> <p>As you an see, we call the PROSAIL function, nested in another function called <code>spectra</code>. This function directly extracts the resulting spectrum from the <code>speclib</code>-object that is created by the <code>PROSAIL</code> function. These speclib-objects contain a lot more detailed information about the function call etc. and it would also be possible to directly plot these objects. However, using the <code>spectra</code>-function will give us some advantages for some of the other plots that will follow below and we hence already introduce this approach here. To plot the spectrum, we run the following code:</p> <pre><code>plot(400:2500, veg_spectrum[1,], type=\"l\", ylab=\"reflectance\", xlab=\"wavelength [nm]\", ylim=c(0,0.5), xlim=c(400,2500))\ngrid()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>One important thing to consider is, that the variable veg_spectrum is only containing the reflectance values (plotted on the y-axis) while the corresponding wavelengths are not available anymore after applying the <code>spectra</code> function. We hence have to know in this case, that PROSAIL simulates the reflectance of the vegetation layer with the defined traits for the wavelengths between 400 and 2500 nm (at steps of 1 nm). We can then plot the reflectance values in the veg_spectrum variable over the wavelengths by providing a sequence (400:2500) as x-values in the plot.</p> <p>You can now play around a bit with this simple way of calling <code>PROSAIL</code> and check how the spectrum changes if you change one or more of the vegetation traits during the call of the <code>PROSAIL</code>-function.</p>"},{"location":"radiative-transfer-model/radiative-transfer-model/#step-2-examining-the-influence-of-individual-traits-on-the-prosail-signal","title":"Step 2: Examining the influence of individual traits on the PROSAIL signal","text":"<p>The hsdar package provides a nice tools to simulate several spectra at the same time. To make use of this tool, we have to define a dataframe in which value ranges for all of the to be varied plant traits are stored. In the example below, we will only vary a single parameter and leave the remaining parameters at their default value.</p> <p>For this, we first create a dataframe called parameter in which we add one column named \u201cLAI\u201d and in which we store 10 different values for the LAI parameter:</p> <pre><code># simulate and plot multiple vegetation spectra\n#define parameter space\nparameter &lt;- data.frame(LAI = seq(1,5, length.out=10))\nparameter\n</code></pre> <pre><code>        LAI\n1  1.000000\n2  1.444444\n3  1.888889\n4  2.333333\n5  2.777778\n6  3.222222\n7  3.666667\n8  4.111111\n9  4.555556\n10 5.000000\n</code></pre> <p>It is of course als possible to vary more than one parameter at the same time. To see how this works, please have a look at the help of the \u201cPROSAIL\u201d function. In our case we will now call the PROSAIL function again and make use of the additional parameter \u201cparameterList\u201d which we will set to the just created dataframe named \u201cparameter\u201d:</p> <pre><code>veg_spectra = spectra(PROSAIL(parameterList = parameter))\n</code></pre> <p>This will results in a total of 10 spectra.

I hope that all of you see the benefits of using such models for better understanding how certain plants traits affect the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation in different wavelengths.

That is, some changes might have occurred in the vegetation composition in the meantime - even though the ecosystem can be considered rather stable. Furthermore, the HyMap data provides notably more spectral information which may also be crucial to sucessfully map the subtle changes in the vegetation composition that finally explain the variance in N indicator values.

It is actually a quite simple formula where we first calculate the squared difference of all point pairs (z(i) and z(i+h)) that can be derived at a given lag-distance h. We then sum these squared differences and divide the sum by two times the number of point pairs at the given lag-distance (2N(h)):</p> <p> </p> <p>A short reminder: the lag-distance is the distance between two points (or pixels). If we have a pixel size of 100 m then a lag distance of 100 m would mean that directly neighboring pixels are paired. If the lag distance would be 300 m then each pixel would be paired with pixels that are located 3 pixels away (in other words, there are two pixels inbetween the two pixels that will be paired). Remember also this graph:</p> <p> </p> <p>By comparing the semi-variances of point pairs with different lag-distances, we can quantify/depict how the spatial distance influences the correlation between points. Remember, the semi-variance will be low (values show low variance and are hence very similar) for highly correlated values, while it will be high for point-pairs with low correlation.</p> <p>Before we proceed with the calculation of the semi-variance, we will have to load our datasets by running the following code:</p> <pre><code># load required packages (as usual, please install missing packages)\nrequire(raster)\nrequire(rgdal)\nrequire(usdm)\n\n# set working directory that contains the data\nsetwd(\"D:/Multiskalige_FE/5_Practicals/Tag_4\")\n\n# load tif file containing landscape metric (here prop. forest area in a 500 x 500 m area)\nimg &lt;- stack(\"prop_forest_area.tif\")\n\n# load shapefile (polyline) that contains the transect for which we want to calculate\n# the semivariogram and the autocorelogram\nshp &lt;- readOGR(\".\", \"transect_ka\")\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we will intersect the raster-file with the transect and extract the values of the raster file for all pixels along the transect. We use the \"unlist()\" function as the extract command in this case will return a list. </p> <pre><code># overlay the shapefile-transect with the image and derive the raster values\n# as the extract command delivers a list, we use the unlist command to \n# decompose the list to a vector file\npr_for&lt;- unlist(extract(img, shp))\n</code></pre> <p>We can now have a look at the extracted values by running:</p> <pre><code>pr_for\n</code></pre> <p>This will show us:</p> <p> </p> <p>These will be the values for which we calculate our semi-variogram. To do this, we will now first derive the spatial resolution of our image as this will determine the rythm of our lag-distances. It would not make sense to select for example a lag distance of 1 m if our pixel size is 10 m as we would not be able to build pairs with pixels that are only 1 m apart.</p> <pre><code># get the pixel size of the image using the res() command of the raster package\nres_img &lt;- res(img)[1]\nres_img\n</code></pre> <p>This will return a value of 500 which indicates that our raster dataset has a spatial resolution of 500 m. That means that our lag-distances will be 500, 1000, 1500, 2000,... and so on.</p> <p>We calculate a vector with the corresponding values using the following code:</p> <pre><code># create a vector file with the same length as the extracted values of the transect\n# which indicates the position on the transect. As each pixel is 500 m large, we use\n# steps of 500 m.\ntr_pos &lt;- seq(res_img, length(pr_for)*res_img, res_img)\n</code></pre> <p>These values at the same time indicate the position of each pixel on the transect.</p> <p>We will now calculate the semi-variance for the different lag-distances. Based on the function available in R, this requires several steps and the calculation might not be 100% intuitive at the first glance. However, when putting some thought into it, it should become quite clear.</p> <p>First, we calculate the distance of each pixel to all other pixels on the transect by running:</p> <pre><code># calculate the lag-distances between each point\nlag &lt;- dist(tr_pos)\nlag\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in a quite bix matrix looking like that:</p> <p></p> <p>You can interpret this like this: the column named 1 represents the first pixel on the transect. In the rows you can then see the lag distance to each of the pixels that follows. The second column represents the second pixel on the transect, the third column the third pixel and so on. This matrix will help us later on to identify all point pairs with a unique lag distance. </p> <p>Next, we calculate the semivariance for all point pairs by running:</p> <pre><code>varTP &lt;- dist(pr_for)^2*.5\nvarTP\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in a matrix with the same structure as our lag-matrix, we have just calculated, but of course the values are different.</p> <p>It is important to understand that we now already have all important inputs together to calculate the mean semivariances for all lag-distances. The two things that are still missing are: </p> <ol> <li>we have to split our varTP matrix to be able to treat the semi-variances for each lag-distance individually</li> <li>we have to calculate the mean semi-variance for each lag distance (the N in the formular has not been considered yet).</li> </ol> <p>We accomplish this by first running:</p> <pre><code># split the seminvariance values up depending on what spatial lag they occur at    \nTP.split&lt;-split(varTP,lag)     \nTP.split\n</code></pre> <p>Here we can now see the semi-variances for each lag-distance. In the figure below the last few entries are shown where we can see that the number of point pairs constantly decreases and that for the largest lag-distance (22000 m) only one point pair is available:</p> <p></p> <p>Next, we calculate the mean semi-variance for each lag-distance by running:</p> <pre><code># compute the mean semivariance at each spatial lag\nTP.gamma &lt;- sapply(TP.split,mean) \nTP.gamma\n</code></pre> <p>This simply calculates the mean value for each of the lines of values depicted in the preceeding figure.</p> <p>This will result in one value (the mean semi-variance) for each lag-distance:</p> <p></p> <p>Now we have all the information to plot our semi-variogram by simply plotting the mean semivariance over the lag-distance.</p> <p>The corresponding code looks like this:</p> <pre><code># extract the values of the unique spatial lags\nlag.uni&lt;- as.numeric(names(TP.gamma))\n# visually examine the variogram for the landscape metric and the transect\nplot(lag.uni,TP.gamma,xlab='Spatial Lag (m)',ylab='Semivariance Forest prop. [%]',type='o') \nabline(v=max(lag)/2,lwd=2,col='dodgerblue',lty=2)\n</code></pre> <p>The will lead to this graph:</p> <p></p> <p>We have now plotted the semi-variogram across all possible lag-distances, however, as we discussed before, the large lag-distances have only very few points left and they might hence have a very limited reliability. Typically it is recommended to only consider lag-distances up to half of the maximum lag-distance. The corresponding lag-distance is marked with the blue dashed line in the graph.</p> <p>If we compare this graph with the original raster dataset, we can interpret the semi-variogram a bit. The maximum semivariance is reached at a lag-distance of 2500 m (or five pixels) - i we have a look at the raster dataset we can see that there are several elements of the landscape along the transect that are approximately 5 pixels long. There is a almost forest-free zone 6 pixels at the Eastern start of the transect, then there is a fully forest covered area which also covers 5 pixels, afterwards there is another forest-free zone of 4-5 pixels followed again by a sparsely forested areas with a length of about 6 pixels. At lag-distances smaller than these landscape element sizes, the correlation between the values will be high (the semi-variance low) while at larger lag-distances, they will get small.</p> <p>This matches the curve depicted in the semi-variogram. Hence, at the given spatial grain of 500 m, the landscape elements along our transect tend to change every 2500 m and even though there are some more fluctuation afterwards, we could be quite sure that if we take some sort of field measurements and make sure that each maesurement is at least 2500 m away from all other measurements, there should be no problem with spatial autocorrelation in the models we build from these data. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"spatial_autocorrelation/spatial_autocorrelation/#step-3-calculating-the-autocorrelogram","title":"Step 3: Calculating the Autocorrelogram","text":"<p>In this part of the tutorial, we will calculate the autocorrelogram.

As we are working with regular distances (each measurement on the transect is equally far away from the next measurement), this does not affect the results.</p> <p>This has to be considered when finally plotting the autocorrelogram. We use the variable tr_pos containing the lag-distances (created in Step 2) to define the lag distances on the x-axis. We can then plot the autocorrelogram using the following code:</p> <pre><code># plot the autocorrelogram \n# we use tr_pos[1:43] as for the way we calculate the spatial autocorrelation no value is avaiable for the first and last lag-distances\nplot(tr_pos[1:43],correl,xlab='Spatial lag (m)',ylab='Autocorrelation',main='Forest Proportion',type='o')\nabline(v=max(tr_pos)/2,col='dodgerblue',lty=2,lwd=2)\nabline(h=0)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following graph:</p> <p></p> <p>As we can see, the curve is very similar to the semi-variogram but mirrored. One thing that might have to be discussed, is the fact that correlations can be positive and negative and hence the optimal lag-distance at which no spatial autocorrelation occurs anymore might be interpreted differently in this graph (the curve starts fluctuating around 0 at approximately 3500-4000 m instead of the maximum semi-variance that was achieved at 2500 m.</p>"},{"location":"spatial_autocorrelation/spatial_autocorrelation/#step-4-calculating-a-semivariogram-for-a-raster-file","title":"Step 4: Calculating a Semivariogram for a Raster-file","text":"<p>In the preceeding steps, we calculated the semivariogram and the autocorrelogram in a rather \"manual\" way, which helps to understand what steps are required to produce the final graphs. On the negative side, the methods we used above are only suitable for a 1D-transect. However, in remote sensing we are typically working with raster datasets and it is of course also possible to calculate variograms for 2D-environments. Then, the pixel-pairs are not only created in the 1D space but in the 2D space. The remaining calculations are the same.</p> <p>In R, there is a package that allows to calculate Variograms for single-band raster layers. The code is really simple:</p> <pre><code>## calculate a variogram from a raster using the usdm package\n## the function has some additional settings that can be checked using\n## ?Variogram\n## in many cases the standard settings should be ok\nvar_ras &lt;- Variogram(img[[1]])\nplot(var_ras)\n</code></pre> <p>Running this code, will lead to:</p> <p></p> <p>As we can see, this variogram looks a lot smoother than the semi-variogram we computed for the transect. This might be due to the fact, that by considering more pixels in the raster, the number of point pairs is a lot higher and the semi-variogram is less influenced by the the particular landscape structure along the transect. When checking the information provided for the function Variogram() (by typing):</p> <pre><code>?Variogram\n</code></pre> <p>you will find out that the function actually is not using all pixels to calculate the semi-variogram but takes a random sample of pixels, representative of the raster layer. You can change the amount of pixels used during that step. It is also possible to change the lag-interval. In the standard setting, the pixel size is used, similarly as we did in the 1D-example above. However, it is possible to also use larger intervals. This might be relevant for analysing very high resolution images where not all possible lag-distances may have to be considered to get a meaningful diagram.</p> <p>This was the last part of the Tutorial and in ideal case, you will now have a better understanding what semi-variograms and auto-correlograms are and how they are computed.

E.g., to install the package \"raster\" use the code:</p> <pre><code>install.packages(\"raster\")\n</code></pre> <p>After all packages are successfully installed, we will load the hyperspectral image and the shapefile containing the reference information.

Next, we will plot our hyperspectral image (hym_img) as well as the reference data stored in the loaded shapefile (ref).  You can see in the code below, that we will select the bands number 21, 14 and 7 to plot a RGB-composit of the hyperspectral image. This leads to an Color-Infrared-View of the image because the band 21 is located in the NIR, the band 14 in the red region and band 7 in the green region. We will furthermore plot the reference data on top of the image using the species information to color-code each sample. The species information is stored in the attribute table of the Shapefile in the column named \"id\" which can be accessed with the setting col=ref@data$id.</p> <pre><code># plot CIR view of hyperspectral image\nplotRGB(hym_img, r=21, g=14, b=7, stretch=\"hist\")\n# add reference points\npar(new=T)\nplot(ref, col=ref@data$id, add=T)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>In the given plot, coniferous stands are depicted in green and broadleaved stands in red. This is because broadleaved stands have a higher reflectance in the near-infrared region than coniferous stands. You can also see that the reference points are depicted in different colors and are mostly crowded in individual forest stands. This is due to the fact, that these stands contain mostly a single species and can hence serve as reliable reference areas to collect samples that we will use to train the algorithm. In total, we consider five tree species, that we will introduce later on. Already now, we can see that one species (Fagus sylvatica) is not occurring in pure stands (this can be seen because pure stands appear just in green or just in red colors). You can see that all the dark blue samples are occurring in rather heterogeneous stands with mixed green and red areas.</p> <p>As next step, we will now extract the spectral values of the HyMap image at each of the 250 reference point locations. So we will have 50 spectral signatures for each tree species. To do this we run:</p> <pre><code># extract spectral signatures at the reference data points\nref_data_tr &lt;- extract(hym_img, ref)\n</code></pre> <p>Depending on the performance of your computer, this will take a bit of time, as the image has quite a lot of bands. Once, we have extracted the values, we will transform the resulting data matrix into a data frame by running:</p> <pre><code>ref_data_tr &lt;- as.data.frame(ref_data_tr)\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we can have a look at the extracted spectral signature by running the plot command in a loop to plot all spectral signatures into the same plot window:</p> <pre><code># plot all spectra and color-code with species\ndev.off()\nfor (i in 1:nrow(ref_data_tr)){\n\n  par(new=T) \n  plot(1:125, ref_data_tr[i,], type=\"l\", col=ref@data$id[i], ylim=c(0,6000), ylab=\"Reflectance\", xlab=\"HyMap band\")\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following image:</p> <p></p> <p>What is not optimal in this graph is that the x-axis does not show the wavelengths, but the band number of the HyMap sensor. This can be fixed by providing the center-wavelengths of HyMap instead as an array instead of the simple sequence from 1 to 125 (the code part is: 1:125) as done at the moment. However, because it is not really relevant for this tutorial, we will not spend more time on this for now.</p> <p>In the plot, we used the species information to color-code the spectra, but as you can see this graph is quite chaotic, and it is hard to see where the spectra of one species ends and the spectra of another species start. All in all, there seems to be quite a heavy overlap between the spectral signatures of the five species. So let us try to make this plot a bit clearer by plotting the mean spectral signature of each species plus its standard deviations.</p> <p>We will need a bit more code to do this. There are definitely ways to code this with less lines of code, however, the solution given below makes the logical flow quite clear and may be easier to understand for people who are not yet professionals in R.

But let us explore, what can be achieved.</p>"},{"location":"treespeciesclassification/treespeciesclassification/#step-2-tree-species-classification-using-the-original-hymap-bands","title":"Step 2: Tree species classification using the original HyMap bands","text":"<p>We will now prepare and run the first classification approach using all 125 bands of the HyMap image. For this, we first prepare two variables. One contains all the spectral signatures of the training data (trainval) and one that contains the corresponding response value (the information to which tree species the sample belongs - coded as a number between 1 and 5) (treespec).</p> <pre><code>############################################\n# prepare classification using original bands\n############################################\ntrainval &lt;- ref_data_tr[,1:125]\ntreespec &lt;- ref_data_tr$id\n</code></pre> <p>As we can see, we obtain both of these variables from the ref_dara_tr dataframe which contains the spectral signature in columns 1 to 125 and the reference data in column 126 (the latter can also be directly accessed via the column name).</p> <p>Now we are ready to start the classification. As you might already know, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, typically require a parameter tuning. That is, we try to identify the optimal settings of the classification algorithm by splitting the dataset into several parts and then use some of these parts to train the classifier (with a set of parameters) and then validate them with another part which has not been used during training. By repeatedly varying the parameters, we can find a combination of parameters, that performs exceptionally well.</p> <p>In the case of SVM we can vary two parameters: gamma and cost. Gamma defines how flexible the so-called hyperplane is allowed to be. The hyperplane is basically the separation-\"line\" between the different classes in the feature space. On the other hand, cost describes how strongly the classifier punishes a wrongly classified sample. If cost and/or Gamma is too high, there is a risk of overfitting - however, by applying datasplits during the grid search, overfitted models will lead to bad performances. By using an automated grid-search which varies the gamma and cost values within a user-defined range, it is possible to automatically search for a good gamma/cost combination in R. The corresponding code looks like this (this might take a while to run, as a lot of different models are examined here): </p> <pre><code># set a seed to allow for reproducing the results\nset.seed(1173)\n# set a range of gamma and cost values to be tested in the parameter tuning\ngammat = seq(.1, .9, by = .1)\ncostt = seq(1,128, by = 12)\n# check the parameters to be tested\ngammat\ncostt   \n# run the parameter tuning\ntune1 &lt;- tune.svm(trainval, as.factor(treespec), gamma = gammat, cost=costt)\n# plot the results of the parameter tuning\nplot(tune1)\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see we will test 9 different values for gamma and 11 different cost-values. In theory, it would of course be possible to test even more combinations but the ones selected here are working quite well from our experience. However, feel free to try out some higher and lower values if you are interested in the results. The code above will lead to the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>This plot summarizes the performances obtained with the examined gamma and cost values. The legend is showing the error rate. So that means, the higher we set gamma, the larger the errors were during the parameter tuning. On the other hand, cost did not have a notable effect on the parameter tuning in the given example.</p> <p>We will now extract the best identified gamma and cost value by running:</p> <pre><code>gamma &lt;- tune1$best.parameters$gamma\ncost &lt;- tune1$best.parameters$cost\n</code></pre> <p>Then we are ready to train the SVM classification. We will train two different models, one model in which all available data will be used for training the model (maximizing the available information) and a second model which is additionally applying a 10-fold cross-validation which we can use to get an idea of how well the classification is able to classify the reference samples correctly.</p> <pre><code># train the model with all available samples\nmodel &lt;- svm(trainval, as.factor(treespec), gamma = gamma, cost = cost, probability = TRUE)\n# train model with 5-fold cross-validation to get first impression on accuracies\nmodel2 &lt;- svm(trainval, as.factor(treespec), gamma = gamma, cost = cost, probability = TRUE, cross=10)\n</code></pre> <p>This should run quite fast and we can not have a look at the model results by running:</p> <pre><code>summary(model2)\n</code></pre> <p>This should show something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>So we can see that we have a mean overall accuracy of approximately 72%. This is not bad but also not really good. We can now also apply this classification model to the full image by running:</p> <pre><code># set output directory to save the classification map   \nsetwd(\"D:/1_tree_species_Karlsruhe/2_data/results\")\n# apply the classification model to the hyperspectral image using the predict function\nsvmPred &lt;- predict(hym_img, model, filename=\"tree_spec_map.tif\", na.rm=TRUE, progress='text', format='GTiff', datatype='INT1U',overwrite=TRUE)\n</code></pre> <p>This process may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer. We can then plot the predicted map using:</p> <pre><code># plot the resulting tree species map\nplot(svmPred)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"1 = Quercus robur\", \"2 = Pinus sylvestris\", \"3 = Quercus rubra\", \"4 = Fagus sylvatica\", \"5 = Pseudotsuga menziesii\"))\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following tree species map:</p> <p></p> <p>On the first glance, this map looks quite plausible. We can see that many of the stands from which we collected the training data (and we hence know, that they are composed of a single species) appear quite homogeneous in the classification map. The quality of the map could be examined with more details by loading the map into QGIS and compare it to the reference maps provided with the tutorial materials and maybe also by comparing the map with additional high-resolution Google or Bing maps which can be visualized in QGIS as well. </p>"},{"location":"treespeciesclassification/treespeciesclassification/#step-3-tree-species-classification-using-pca-bands","title":"Step 3: Tree species classification using PCA bands","text":"<p>One way to improve the accuracy of supervised classifications, particularly if working with hyperspectral data are feature extraction methods as they allow to compress the feature space and hence reduce colinearity of predictors. In the following we will apply the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) to the hyperspectral image to reduce the original 125 bands to a smaller number of bands carrying most of the variability contained in the image.</p> <p>To apply a PCA to a raster dataset, we can use the rasterPCA function of the RStoolbox package. The function actually uses only a subset of pixels to calculate the PCA transformation and then only applies the transformation to the full raster stack. In the example below, we use 1000 sample points. The more points are used, the longer the PCA calculation may last. We also set the spca parameter to TRUE to scale all the bands (this is not absolutely necessary but may be reasonable to do in our case as for example vegetation spectra have differing reflectance value ranges in the visual and near-infrared region; by scaling all value ranges of the bands, such constant differences are smoothed out). If you are interested whether this has any effect, you can also re-run the code later and switch off the spca parameter. To run the PCA in R we execute the following code (this may take a while!):</p> <pre><code>############################################\n# prepare classification using PCA\n############################################\n\npca &lt;- rasterPCA(hym_img, nSamples=5000, spca=T)\n</code></pre> <p>From the resulting pca object, we can extract the transformation model:</p> <pre><code>pca_ras &lt;- pca$map\n</code></pre> <p>As well as the new raster stack containing the PCA components (125 components/raster layers sorted from high to low information content)</p> <pre><code>pca_mod &lt;- pca$model\n</code></pre> <p>To check how much of the overall variability the individual components are carrying, we can have a look at an eigenvalue scree plot using the fviz-eig function from the factoextra package:</p> <pre><code>fviz_eig(pca_mod)\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>As we can see, the first seven components seem to already carry the vast majority of the variability in the hyperspectral image. Starting from the 8th component, the information content seems to be rather low. However, we can also check this by plotting the individual components. We can for example compare the first three components with the last three components by running:</p> <pre><code>x11()\ndev.off()\npar(mfrow=c(2,3))\nplot(pca_ras[[c(1:3, 123:125)]])\n</code></pre> <p>this will result in the following plot:</p> <p></p> <p>As we can see, the first three PCs show quite a lot of variation related to the image contents. PC3 does not show too many patterns, due to a few outlayer value in the urban area (the green dot) - but PC3 actually still does contain a lot variation (this would become visible if the image stretched would be adapted). On the other hand, the last three PCs seem to only show random noise. Based on the combination of the eigenvalue plot above and this visual examination we can now decide how many of the PCs we want to use in our classification. For now, we will simply select the first 15 components assuming that most of the variability in the image is covered by these components. Hence, we extract the values of the first 15 PCs from the reference sample locations using:</p> <pre><code>trainval_pca &lt;- extract(pca_ras[[1:15]], ref)\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we run the same SVM classification as we did before, including also the parameter tuning:</p> <pre><code>set.seed(1173)\n# parameter tuning\ngammat = seq(.1, .9, by = .1)\ncostt = seq(1,128, by = 12)\ntune2 &lt;- tune.svm(trainval_pca, as.factor(treespec), gamma = gammat, cost=costt)\nplot(tune2)\n# extract best parameters\ngamma2 &lt;- tune2$best.parameters$gamma\ncost2 &lt;- tune2$best.parameters$cost\n\n# train the model with all available samples\nmodel_pca &lt;- svm(trainval_pca, as.factor(treespec), gamma = gamma2, cost = cost2, probability = TRUE)\n# train model with 10-fold cross-validation to get first impression on accuracies\nmodel_pca2 &lt;- svm(trainval_pca, as.factor(treespec), gamma = gamma2, cost = cost2, probability = TRUE, cross=10)\nsummary(model_pca2)\n</code></pre> <p>This will produce the following output (you will additionally see the plot from the parameter tuning, but you are already familiar with this step, so I will not repeat it here):</p> <p></p> <p>As we can see, the classification accuracy using only the first 15 PCA components as input is slightly better than the accuracy we obtained using all hyperspectral bands. Your results might vary slightly, depending on how you set your seed value in the function set.seed().</p> <p>Finally, let us also produce a prediction map for this classification approach by running the following code:</p> <pre><code># set output directory\nsetwd(\"D:/1_tree_species_Karlsruhe/2_data/results\")\n# apply classifier to full image    \nsvmPred_pca &lt;- predict(pca_ras[[1:15]], model_pca, filename=\"tree_spec_map_pca.tif\", na.rm=TRUE, progress='text', format='GTiff', datatype='INT1U',overwrite=TRUE)\n</code></pre> <p>We can also have a look at this map by running:</p> <pre><code>dev.off()\nplot(svmPred_pca)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"1 = Quercus robur\", \"2 = Pinus sylvestris\", \"3 = Quercus rubra\", \"4 = Fagus sylvatica\", \"5 = Pseudotsuga menz.\"))\n</code></pre> <p>Which will result in:</p> <p></p> <p>This map looks quite similar as the one from the preceeding classification. This is no surprise as the classification accuracies were also similar.</p>"},{"location":"treespeciesclassification/treespeciesclassification/#step-4-tree-species-classification-using-a-combination-of-feature-selection-vsurf-and-feature-extraction-pca","title":"Step 4: Tree species classification using a combination of feature selection (VSURF) and feature extraction (PCA)","text":"<p>In this final step of the Tutorial, we will now add another step. We will use the first 30 components of the PCA as our starting input dataset.

This algorithm is based on Random Forest and in some of our recent studies it performed quite well. Some more detailed descriptions on VSURF can be found in Genuer, R., Poggi, J.-M., Tuleau-Malot, C., 2015. VSURF: an r package for VariableSelection using random forests. R J. R Found. Statist. Comput. 7 (2), 19\u201333. Be aware that I set the option parallel to TRUE and ncores = 3. This means in this case, R will use 3 CPUs/cores to run the algorithm. In case your computer only has one core/CPU, you have to set parallel to FALSE. If you do not know how many cores your computer has, you can also try to run the code and if it fails, you can reduce the number of cores or deactivate the parallel setting.</p> <pre><code>vsurf_pca &lt;- VSURF(trainval_pca2, as.factor(treespec), ntree=500, parallel = T, ncores = 3)\n</code></pre> <p>The resulting vsurf_pca object contains three sets of selected variables.
